Many years ago I was enjoying in the harbor of New York
the charming hospitalities of the officers belonging
to one of the finest vessels in the British
Navy. The company was gay, cultivated and brilliant. Student
and recluse as I then was, I was perhaps more delighted
than any one present with the conversation of those practical
and polished men of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After supper I was attracted to a small group of earnest
talkers, of whom the surgeon of the ship seemed to be the
centre and oracle. He was speaking of exhumations a long
time after death, of mummies and petrifactions and other curious
transformations of the human body. He stated that he
had examined some of the skeletons which had been dug out
of the ruins of Herculaneum. The bones were almost perfect
after the lapse of eighteen hundred years. The complete
exclusion of air and water seemed to be the only thing necessary
to an indefinite preservation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chaplain of the vessel endeavored to give the conversation
an æsthetic and semi-religious turn by analyzing the
feelings of mingled awe, melancholy and curiosity with which
most men survey the remains of a human form—feelings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>always heightened by the antiquity of the relic, and by the dignity
of the person who lived and loved and labored in it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The fundamental idea,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is a profound respect
for the human body itself as the casket which has contained
the spiritual jewel, the soul.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> remarked the surgeon; <span class="tei tei-q">“nothing but the lapse of a
people into cannibalism can obliterate that sentiment. When
the Egyptian embalmers were ready for their work, a certain
person came forward and made the necessary incisions for
taking out the entrails. He immediately fled away, pursued
by volleys of stones and curses from all the others. Hence
also the dissections of the dead by medical students are conducted
with the utmost secrecy and caution.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Schiller,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“makes one of his heroes remark that
the first time he plunged his sword into a living man, he felt a
shudder creep over him as if he had desecrated the temple of
God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Besides the feeling of reverence,”</span> continued the clergyman,
<span class="tei tei-q">“we have the awe which death naturally inspires, the
    <a name="corr010" id="corr010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">melancholy</span>
excited by the vain and transitory nature of earthly
things; and lastly, a tender and curious interest for the brother-soul
which has tasted the sweetness of life and the bitterness
of death, and passed onward to those hidden but grander experiences
which await us all.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Those shocking Egyptian mummies,”</span> said one of the
officers, <span class="tei tei-q">“are so disgusting that a strange horror is mingled
with the gentler emotions you describe.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I experienced that feeling,”</span> said another, <span class="tei tei-q">“on reading an
account of the exhumation of the remains, or rather the opening
of the coffin, of King Charles I., two hundred years after
he had been beheaded. It was increased, doubtless, by the
idea of the separated head and body, and the strange and lifelike
stare of the king’s eyes, which collapsed like soap-bubbles
when they were exposed to the air.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There was something of the picturesque in that finding
of a dead body by some little children who were playing in a
grotto in France. It was seated on a stone bench and perfectly
petrified, retaining, however, a sweet and placid expression
of countenance. The man was an old hermit, who frequently
retired into the deepest chamber of the grotto for
religious contemplation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Imagine yourself,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the silence and shadows
of Westminster Abbey, peering through some crevice in an
old vault and getting a sight of the shrunken dust of Shakespeare.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Passing from imagination to fact,”</span> said solemnly the old
surgeon, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have seen the body of a man lying upon the
ground where it had lain undisturbed for eighteen hundred
years.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Eighteen hundred years!”</span> exclaimed several voices at
once.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, eighteen hundred years; and I was the first person
who set eyes upon him from the day of his death until I got
into the cavern where he perished.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A romance! a romance!”</span> cried the minister. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come,
doctor, be communicative and tell us all about it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is not a romance,”</span> said the doctor, <span class="tei tei-q">“but the facts were
certainly very curious.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When I was a young assistant surgeon, attached to the
sloop-of-war Agamemnon, we were skirting leisurely the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean, and anchored one morning
in sight of the ruins of the ancient city of Sidon and opposite
the westernmost spurs of Lebanon, the Mont Blanc of
Palestine.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is only one picture grander than a view of Mount
Lebanon from the sea, and that is a view of the sea from
Mount Lebanon. I enjoyed the former so keenly that I
determined to obtain the latter also. We got up a party of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>genial and stout fellows to ascend one of the highest peaks,
armed with pick-axes, to obtain geological specimens on our
way.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We had advanced but a short distance up one of the cliffs,
when we started from the scanty undergrowth some little animal—a
wolf or jackal or wild dog, all of which abound on
Mount Lebanon. We all joined noisily in the chase, and soon
ran the frightened creature into one of the deep crevices or
fissures made in the earth by the tempestuous rains of that
region. Our picks were immediately brought into play, and
in a short time, to our very great astonishment, instead of
digging the fugitive out of a little hole in the ground, we
opened our way into what was evidently the rear or back part
of a cave of considerable dimensions.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Our party crawled in one after another, myself leading the
way. The contents of the place arrested our attention so
strongly that we forgot the object of our chase, which had
buried itself in some holes or burrows at the side of the cavern.
The floor was of a yellowish-white limestone, and all
eyes were immediately directed, in the rather dim light, to the
figure of a man outstretched upon it.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, it was a man whose entire body, clothing and all,
had dissolved into one blended mass, and so long ago that it
looked rather like a great bas-relief of the human form projecting
from the lighter-colored floor.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The shape of the head and of the long hair and beard was
complete. One outstretched arm lay along the floor, and
the fingers could be traced by little ridges separate from each
other. The protuberances of all the bony parts showed that
the skeleton still resisted the disintegrating process of decay.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What an awful death he must have experienced! For
there was not a single other object in the small space which
remained of the cavern; not a stone which might have served
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for a seat or a table; not an earthen vessel which might have
contained a draught of water.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The fate of this unhappy being was evident. Whether
he had lived in the cavern or whether he had taken refuge in it
from some great storm, he had clearly rushed to the back part
of it to escape some enormous landslide and caving in at the
front, which had opened toward the sea. He had been buried
alive! Having exhausted the little air that remained to him,
stricken down by terror, despair and suffocation, he had rendered
up his soul to the great Giver in silence, darkness and
solitude.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These facts were so obvious that we all lifted our hats
before speaking a word; thus paying the tribute of human
sympathy to a fellow-creature eighteen hundred years after he
had ceased to need it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How did you fix upon the date of his death?”</span> asked the
chaplain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will see. A large cylindrical case of bronze was
lying upon the breast of the dead man. He must have valued
it highly, for he had clasped it to his bosom in the agonies of
death. It was hermetically sealed with such ingenuity that we
found considerable difficulty in breaking it open. It contained
a parchment of great length, and rolled tightly around a little
brass rod. The parchment was closely written in beautiful
Greek characters. It was perfectly preserved. Two small
gold coins fell out of the white dry sand with which the case
had been filled. One of them bore the inscription of Tiberius
Cæsar, and the other was stamped in the ninth year of the
reign of the emperor Nero. Thus in the accidental grave of
its author had his book been safely preserved amid all the
mutations of the world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old doctor stroked his gray beard in silence, and I exclaimed:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who do you suppose this unfortunate man to have been?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That was revealed in the manuscript, but unfortunately
not one of our party could read Greek. I sent the case with
its contents to an old uncle of my mother, who had a little
curacy near Binghamton. He was a great Greek scholar,
and devoted to his classical studies the little time he could
spare from the game of whist. I had a good deal of curiosity
on the subject, and wrote several times to my uncle from
different parts of the world before he condescended to reply.
His answer was in substance this: that the manuscript purported
to be the autobiography of Eleazor or Lazarus, whom
Christ raised from the dead; that it was probably the work
of some heretic monk or crazy philosopher of the second or
third century; that, interwoven with romantic incidents in this
world and the other, it gave expression to many absurd and
false doctrines; in fine, that it was not worth my reading, and
that I had better devote myself dutifully to killing his Majesty’s
enemies on the high seas, than to searching old caverns
for apocryphal documents which impugned the sacred verities
of the Apostolic Church.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And so,”</span> concluded the old surgeon, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have never
thought any more about it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your uncle was no doubt right in his conjectures and
wise in his advice,”</span> said the young chaplain. <span class="tei tei-q">“The number
and extent of the apocryphal impositions upon the early
Christian Church are almost incredible.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Were you satisfied,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“with your good uncle’s
opinion?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have always believed,”</span> replied the doctor, evasively and
with a roguish twinkle of his eye, <span class="tei tei-q">“that if the manuscript had
contained the Thirty-nine Articles by anticipation, my uncle
would have pronounced it divinely inspired.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What became of it?”</span> I inquired.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, it was sealed up again and sent to the nursery as a
plaything for the children. It is probably still in the possession
of one of my cousins.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The strange story of the old surgeon made a profound impression
upon me; for in spite of the incredulity of all the other
listeners, I believed from the first that the dust of that cavern
was the dust of Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary,
and that the manuscript contained something of genuine value
to the Church and the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The opinion of the old curate and the echo of the young
chaplain did not weigh a feather in my estimation. Young as
I was, I had acquired that rare faculty of thinking for myself.
Besides, I had had learned enough of human nature to know that
legal reforms are rarely suggested by lawyers; that doctors
always make war on a system of medicine better than their
own; and that priests instinctively repudiate anything which
demands a re-examination of the fundamental doctrines of
their theological systems.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had an inextinguishable desire to possess that manuscript,
and set myself earnestly about it. I cultivated the acquaintance
of the genial old surgeon, and contrived to render myself
useful to him on more than one occasion. When he sailed
for England I extorted from him a promise that he would
send me the manuscript of Lazarus which his orthodox uncle
has so flippantly condemned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A good many years passed away, and I heard nothing from
him. At length came a package, and a letter from England
couched in very handsome terms, a part of which ran thus:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My beloved father on his deathbed made up the parcel
which I now send you, and requested me to transmit it to you
with the following message, which he made me write down as
the words fell from his lips:</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Forgive your old acquaintance for neglecting until death
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the matters of the dead. Read what Lazarus says, while I go
in person to verify or invalidate his story. I have lived passably
well, and I die comparatively happy. Good-bye!’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I drew a deep sigh to the memory of the old surgeon, and
set immediately to work studying and translating the manuscript.
I found that a difficult task. It was not written in
very classical Greek, and besides, was full of Hebraisms, which
sometimes obscured the sense. There were not only many
obscure things, but many things irrelevant, and many which
would be regarded as absurd and even childish in the present
age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It soon became clear that a literal translation of the manuscript
would not be of any great interest to the general reader.
I determined to take the astounding facts narrated, as a skeleton
or framework around which to build up a story of my
own. This book is therefore a modern romance founded
upon ancient facts. The original might be called a prose
poem. Indeed, much of it is in the poetical form; the description
of Helena, for instance, in the eleventh chapter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The key to the whole book is, that here are the views and
experiences of a man who, by what we may call a supernatural
accident, was led into states of thought two thousand years in
advance of his contemporaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I present it to the public in a dress of the nineteenth century,
hoping it will reverse the decision of the old curate, who
understood Greek and whist better than he did the inappeasable
hunger of the soul after the unknown, and perhaps,
alas! the unknowable.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was born in the little village of Bethany, which sits
upon the eastern slope of Mount Olivet, embowered all
summer in leaves and fruit. There were four children in
the family; and our mother died in giving birth to Mary,
the youngest and most beautiful. Our father was a man
of great wealth and high social position, and we were
reared in the lap of luxury.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My earliest recollection is that of playing in a large, terraced
garden with my brother and two little sisters. The
garden was full of olive, pomegranate, orange and date
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trees, and adorned with a great many shrubs and flowers.
It was cool, fragrant and shady, and we sported about the
tomb of our mother, which was cut in the solid rock, as
merry and innocent as the birds and butterflies which
shared with us the peace and beauty of the summer day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was ten years of age when Samuel, my younger
brother, was taken from us. It was the first real grief
of my life. Although five years old when my mother
died, I was too young to remember the incidents. The
angels are so near us in our infancy, that the troubles of
the world, which are afterward engraved in marble, are
then only written in water.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Little Samuel died calling my name. Oh that I could
have obeyed his call, and followed him into that bright
and peaceful sphere in which I saw him long afterward,
and in which I shall soon see him again!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Early on the day of his burial our father went into the
chamber where lay his little white body covered all over
with whiter flowers. He knelt beside it and wept bitterly.
He seemed unconscious that his three little ones had followed
him, and stood pale and trembling at the door.
When we heard the voice of his weeping we crept forward
to the feet of our little brother and wept also.
Our father kissed us all tenderly, and controlling his
emotions and steadying his voice, he repeated from memory
the beautiful verses of Scripture which describe the
grief and resignation of King David at the loss of his
child.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The body of our little brother was deposited in a niche
in the rock close to the dust of his mother. The garden
was avoided as a playground for a long while. I was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>busy with my books, Martha with her dolls—both rendered
thoughtful beyond our years. One day little Mary
ventured into the garden alone, but presently came running
back and buried her golden head in her sister’s lap
in a shower of tears which needed no explanation. Who
can read the little child’s heart? Perhaps some playmate
bird had called to her: <span class="tei tei-q">“Rosebud! rosebud! where
is your brother?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then came the years of school and opening thought
and expanding faculties, and the first appearance of affections
and passions, no longer the dewdrops of the spring
morning, but the beginnings of deep and swift currents in
the course of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters were remarkable women, differing in style
and character; yet each a perfect picture of female loveliness!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Martha grew tall and firm and straight, with long black
hair and black eyes, a brunette complexion and a finely-cut
oval face. She was the impersonation of a pure and
intelligent womanhood. She was active, observant and
critical. She regulated her life by lofty principle as well
as by noble impulse, and there was something about her
that always impressed you with the idea that she was
brave and strong as well as gentle and pure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary was fragile in form, willowy and graceful in
motion, soft and winning in manners. Her eyes were
blue and sparkling with the tender dew of sentiment.
The lily and the rose contended for supremacy on her
face, and sunbeams nestled always in her hair. She was
the impersonation of a loving and love-awakening womanhood.
Her voice, her smile, her tear, expressed in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>most extraordinary manner the sensitive emotions of her
soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary was my lily; Martha my rose. Martha was my
ruby; Mary my pearl. Martha was reason; Mary was
sentiment. Martha was wisdom; Mary was love. Martha
was faith looking fixedly at the stars; Mary was charity
looking trustfully beyond them to God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My father took a deep interest in the education and
general training of his children. He provided us with
the best teachers in every branch, but let nothing escape
his own watchful supervision. It was greatly due to his
intelligent care and the inspiring stimulus of his affection,
that we attained a degree of mental and social development
rarely witnessed in children of our age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A dark cloud hung over this good and wise father and
his happy little household.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His health had been gradually failing for a long time.
He grew languid, lost appetite, and became slow in his
gait and stiff in his motions. He abandoned his business
in the city, and rarely went out of the house. He declined
receiving visitors, until our home, which had been so gay
and brilliant, became quite deserted and lonely. But his
mental condition underwent a change altogether incommensurate
with his physical symptoms. He became silent
and melancholy, and so unlike his former patient and
sweet self! He repulsed every attempt on our part to
inquire into the nature or cause of his troubles. His
mental faculties were also greatly weakened.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We could not comprehend the meaning of all this. We
became very unhappy. We knew he was wealthy, honored
and beloved—in possession of all that men covet for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>good or evil ends. The country was in a state of profound
repose. It was incredible that the mere approach
of sickness and death, could so change the character of a
good and brave man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My father was now frequently closeted with Caiaphas, a
young priest of stately appearance and ingratiating manners.
I became very anxious to learn the subject of these
prolonged interviews. I once questioned Caiaphas at the
gate about my father’s condition; but he evaded me
adroitly. At last my curiosity, prompted by filial love,
triumphed over my sense of propriety, and I crept to my
father’s door one night, when he and Caiaphas were
together, and applied my ear to the keyhole. For a long
time the tones were too low for me to catch any meaning;
but my father suddenly raised his voice in an excited
manner—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I assure you he is a thief and a robber, and addicted
to magic. O Caiaphas! save my children and their property
from this monster!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was terrified at these words, and slipped away in the
darkness. There was the secret of my father’s grief. He
expected to die very soon, and was anxious for the fate of
his children when he was taken from them. I wept on
my bed nearly all night at the idea of losing my good
parent. But who was this monster he so much dreaded?
That set me to thinking.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When a man died, his minor children and property
passed under the guardianship of his next of kin. My
father had no brothers in Judea, for his only brother had
wandered off more than thirty years before. He was an
eccentric character who forsook his religion and changed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his name. Beyond that we knew nothing of him. Nor
did my father even know where to find him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His only sister was married to Magistus, a citizen of
Bethany. She was a confirmed invalid and never seen.
In the event of my father’s death we would fall to their
care. Magistus then was this terrible monster, a thief and
a magician. I was confirmed in this conclusion by the
fact, that my father and Magistus had long been on bad
terms; and my father was not the man to withdraw his
friendship from a worthy person.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus was a thin, sallow, ugly old man, with an
immense hooked nose like the beak of a bird of prey.
His black eyes were small, fierce and sly. He had a long
dingy beard which he had twisted like a screw. Notwithstanding
this sinister appearance, he had the reputation of
being a good and wise man. People speak well of a rich
man who seems always to retire modestly from the public
eye. Magistus moreover was a great friend of the priesthood
and a favorite with the priests.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I could not reveal to my sisters the approaching death
of our father and the fears he had expressed about our
legal guardian. I was astonished and somewhat relieved
when he passed the warmest eulogy upon Caiaphas the
next morning, and told us to look to him for comfort and
to rely on him for help in the greatest emergencies. What
astonished me still more was, that this reliable friend never
visited my father again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were greatly distressed that no medical aid was
called in. The suggestion was always repudiated with a
strange earnestness. Whatever the disease was with which
our father was afflicted, he was plainly growing worse and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>worse. At last he refused to quit his chamber, or to admit
any one into it. He commanded a little food and water
to be placed upon a table on the gallery underneath his
window; and what was singular, he only took it in during
the night when no one saw him. These things threw us
into the saddest consternation. We began to fear that he
was losing his reason. We were frantic with excitement.
We determined to see him and nurse him. We knocked
at his door and window and entreated him to show himself
to his children.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At last he called out in a voice which showed he had
been weeping:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Calm yourselves, my children! and pray to God.
A great evil has come upon us, which can be concealed
but a little longer. My soul is overwhelmed with misery,
but my heart beats for my children with the tenderest
love. Ask me nothing at present; it is more than I can
bear. If you love me and would obey me, keep away
entirely from my chamber. Let no one come into the
house—and least of all, your uncle Magistus.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were reassured of his love and his rationality by
these words; but they filled us with a vague terror and
overwhelmed us with sorrow. We had no one to appeal
to, no one to consult. We were commanded to keep
everybody away. Thus several weeks of fearful suspense
rolled by. The neighbors began to inquire about my
father. His seclusion became the wonder and talk of
the village. The interrogations, always disagreeable, became
absolutely impertinent. The mystery had excited
suspicion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Worse than all, Magistus became a regular visitor to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the gate. He questioned the porter in the subtlest manner.
He obtained from him the facts that my father had
never received any medical attention, that he had concealed
himself in his chamber, and had not been seen for
weeks, even by his children. He evinced the liveliest
satisfaction. <span class="tei tei-q">“The apple will soon drop,”</span> said he aloud
to himself. All this was faithfully reported to us. Three
little sparrows in a nest among the green leaves, could not
have been in greater trepidation with an ugly bird of prey
gazing at them from a neighboring branch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dénouement approached. We were whispering
our sorrows together one day, seated by the little fountain
in the inner courtyard of the house, upon which the door
of our father’s chamber opened. Suddenly voices and
footsteps were heard approaching. A moment after Magistus
appeared, followed by a venerable-looking old
priest and stately Roman centurion. My sisters clung
to me in terror.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Without noticing us, the party rapped loudly on my
father’s door, and commanded him to come forth. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
the name of the Mosaic law,”</span> said the priest; <span class="tei tei-q">“and by
order of the Roman governor,”</span> added the centurion.
The words were repeated in a louder voice: the door
slowly opened and my father stepped out, exclaiming,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unclean! unclean!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All fell back several paces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The scourge of God!”</span> said the priest with deep
solemnity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Damnable Eastern plague!”</span> muttered the Roman
soldier.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Incurable! incurable!”</span> exclaimed Magistus.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the leprosy!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That ghoul of diseases, which slowly devours a living
victim, had made fearful ravages upon my poor father’s
frame. His eyebrows and eyelashes were gone; his chin
and ears were much swollen, and a pearl-white scaly
ulcer deformed his forehead; his hands had a sickly
and withered appearance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now understood the meaning of his strange conduct.
The disease began first about the joints and the
covered parts of his body. As soon as it broke out on
the skin, the poor man had shut himself up to conceal his
affliction and to avoid contaminating his family. Knowing
himself stricken with a disgusting and incurable malady,
which would exclude him from society and drive him away
from his children, he bore the burden of his awful secret
alone. Magistus had discovered his condition, and anxious
to revenge himself upon virtues he could not imitate, and
to get possession of the property, he laid the case before
the authorities, and insisted that the law of separation
should be executed upon his brother-in-law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the unhappy man stood in the doorway, he turned
his eyes upon the pale faces of his terrified children, and,
silently wringing his hands, looked upward to heaven.
He was turning away, when all three of us sprang forward
at once, and with cries which would have moved
the coldest heart, fell at his feet and clung about his
knees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Touch me not! my sweet children!”</span> he exclaimed,
in a hoarse and feeble voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Touch me not. It is all
over! Caiaphas will befriend my orphans.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He had not finished the words before several strange
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>domestics, who had rushed in at a signal from Magistus,
proceeded to drag us from the spot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Away with them!”</span> said the hideous old man, fiercely.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Confine them in the farthest room. We want no young
lepers—no more scourges of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If it were a scourge of God,”</span> cried I, struggling to
escape, <span class="tei tei-q">“it would have been sent upon you and not upon
my noble father.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were carried weeping out of the courtyard. Looking
back to the door, we saw the unhappy man waving his
last adieu to us with his poor, sickly, withered hands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mosaic law against the unfortunate leper was
cruelly severe; but the Roman power which occupied
the country and feared the ravages of leprosy among the
soldiery, added greatly to its force and to the stringency
of its execution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The leper was sentenced to a social and civil death far
more terrible to a man of sensibility than the mere separation
of soul and body. He was driven from the face of
his fellow-men, and dwelt in caves and hollow trees and
deserted ruins. No one was permitted to touch him, to
approach him, or even to speak to him. He was compelled
to cry out, Unclean! unclean! so as to warn every
one of his dangerous proximity. He became literally the
wild man of the woods and the mountains and the desert—the
companion and sometimes the prey of wild beasts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those who had friends and money had little huts
erected for them in remote but safe places, and were
amply provided with food and even luxuries by servants
who deposited the articles upon the ground at a considerable
distance from their habitations.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the fate of our good and generous father—the
idol of our hearts and the model of all social and
heroic virtues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We spent the night in tears, and the next day in an agony
of grief. I do not know who witnessed the dreadful
ceremonies of the law. He was examined by the proper
inspectors, and pronounced unclean and incurable. He
was led into the great highway. The people stood afar
off. The priest in a loud voice pronounced the curse of
God upon him—the service of the dead over the living
body. He cut him off from the congregation of Israel.
The guards then drove him before them into some uninhabited
place, and he disappeared from the sight of
men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was always visible, however, to the hearts of his
three little orphans. We followed his steps with filial
vigilance. We saw him toiling along in the sand of the
desert, and we shared his burden of heat and hunger and
thirst. We saw him seated under a palm tree, or in the
shadow of some great rock, and we felt the sorrows of his
thoughts as if they were our own. We saw him kneeling
by the brook, and we mingled our prayers with his. We
saw him sleeping in his lonely hut, lighted only by the
moon, and we were comforted by his dream of angels
and heaven.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were now orphans, and of that kind most to be
pitied, who have fallen into the hands of a cold
and selfish step-uncle. He had a father’s power
over us, without a father’s affection to regulate and sanctify
it. There was no one to supervise his conduct toward us;
no appeal from his baseness or cruelty, unless his acts
were so flagrant and unconcealed as to call down the
vengeance of the laws.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This uncle whom we so much dreaded and had so
much reason to dread, wore at first a smooth and pleasing
mask. He came every day to see us, and endeavored
by as much civility and kindness as he could counterfeit,
to soften our feelings and satisfy us with our condition.
He professed the deepest sympathy for our poor father’s
calamity. He regretted the severity of the Jewish and
Roman laws on the subject of leprosy, but excused them
as a necessary protection to society. He assured us that
our father had a comfortable lodge on the border of the
wilderness, and that servants were despatched every other
day with fresh supplies of food and wine and water.
This assurance brought tears to our eyes and comfort to
our hearts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the storm of our grief had abated a little, we
re<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>quested to see our aunt; for we yearned for the presence
and sympathy of woman. Magistus conducted us over
to his residence which adjoined our own, but fronted
upon another street. A high brick wall separated his
garden from ours. He had a door cut in this wall so
as to facilitate the passage from one house to another.
His mansion was completely concealed from the public
eye by a thick grove of trees which surrounded it. In
the most retired chamber of this quiet and really beautiful
place, we found Ulema, my father’s invalid sister.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She was a middle-aged woman of extreme thinness and
pallor. Her face was waxen-colored and ghastly. There
was a wild terrified expression about her black eyes, which
was absolutely painful. She had evidently been a great
sufferer in mind and body. She received us with a faint,
sickly smile, and then her features assumed an expression
of profound pity. We supposed this was on account of
the loss of our father. We did not know the reasons
which the poor woman had for pitying any one who
came within the shadow of Magistus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the interchange of a few commonplaces, our
uncle cut short the visit on the plea of Ulema’s feeble
and nervous condition. This visit was repeated every
Sabbath after the morning sacrifice. Magistus always
accompanied us, and drew us away as quickly as possible.
My aunt had always the same expressions of terror and
pity. Thus our repeated interviews added nothing to
our knowledge of her character. In vain we petitioned
Magistus to let us live with our aunt, or to let us visit her
oftener, or to let us stay longer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our own home was sadly changed. The furniture, the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pictures, the statues, the fountain, the flowers, were all
the same, but there was an air of silence and melancholy
about the whole place, as if the inanimate objects had felt
and shared the misfortunes of the orphan children. There
was a different sphere around us, a different light upon us.
The organizing and unitizing spirit was gone;—the good
and wise father, who made all happy and cheerful about
him, and held his little household together in the sweet
bonds of perfect order and peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was a cruel act of Magistus to substitute servants and
creatures of his own for those who had been with us from
our infancy. We were soon surrounded by strange faces,
so that our father’s house began to appear to us, what it
really was, a prison. The domestics of an establishment
acquire in time a coloring from the kind of life within it,
as insects are colored by the leaves and bark of the trees
they inhabit. Ours were respectful, obedient and cheerful;
these were cunning, insolent and dishonest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief butler or head servant was, however, a good
character, who plays a remarkable part in my story.
He was an African about thirty years of age, very black
and homely. He was a eunuch, and dumb. These disadvantages,
which at first excited a feeling of repulsion,
were atoned for by a singular kindness, deference and
sympathy, which were displayed in his features and
manners. The other servants held him in great awe;
for he had been brought from Egypt about three years
before by a magician, and was supposed to be gifted
with supernatural power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was this advantage in command, as well as a certain
kind of talent, industry and reliability, which induced
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Magistus to give him the supreme charge of both households.
He had been with us but a few days, before he
had quite won our hearts by his friendly attentions and
evident sympathy for our distress. I, who had been made
suspicious by my father’s opinion of our guardian, detected
in the face of Ethopus (for that was his name)
the same expression of pity which shone in the features of
our sick aunt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this, however, he concealed from Magistus with the
greatest care; for he was always cold and impassive toward
us in the presence of his master. Unfortunately
Ethopus was dumb. His communications at this time
might have been of incalculable service to us. I endeavored
to learn something of the habits and character of
my uncle from the other servants, but on that subject
they were as dumb as Ethopus; for whenever I approached
it, they manifested signs of fear, and invariably put the
finger on the lip.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I became dissatisfied with this secresy. I resolved to
teach Ethopus to read and write, so that he might tell me his
own story, and initiate me into the mysteries and dangers
of my position. He comprehended my idea at once, and
came to me secretly at hours when he knew Magistus was
absent. He had made some little progress,—though the
difficulties of the first steps were very great,—when one
evening Magistus walked slyly in and surprised us at our
studies. We had been betrayed by one of the servants,
who all acted as spies on each other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus was in a towering passion. He beat Ethopus
severely, notwithstanding my protestations that I alone
was to blame—and drove him from the room.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Turning fiercely upon me, he exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not know the crime, the danger of teaching
that man to write?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, uncle!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“what harm is there in bestowing
the light of knowledge upon a poor dumb slave?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He was made dumb to keep him from betraying
secrets.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Horrible!”</span> said I.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not my secrets,”</span> he added, cautiously, <span class="tei tei-q">“but his
former master’s. If Simon Magus thought he could
write, he would come all the way from Egypt to cut his
heart out of his body.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After that event, the sphere of Ethopus’ duty was
changed, so that we rarely saw him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several weeks passed away, and we wondered why
Caiaphas, from whom our father expected so much, did
not come to see us. He was to aid and befriend us, and,
as I hoped, to deliver us from the control of Magistus.
He had evidently promised all that to our dear father.
The priestly authorities, if properly applied to, surely
would not permit the children of a good and devout
man to continue under the influence of a thief and
magician.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Caiaphas at last came. His visit was short: his manner
constrained but polite. He sympathized briefly with
our affliction; explained and defended the Mosaic laws
against leprosy; eulogized our father in eloquent terms;
and congratulated us on having such a worthy uncle, who
would train us so carefully in the faith, and who would
make our home so happy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And this was the result of the secret interviews with my
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>father, and of his solemn warnings against Magistus as a
thief and a magician! I was puzzled and disappointed.
I could not help saying:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Did you know, O Caiaphas! that my father entertained
a very different opinion of this good uncle?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Remember, my son,”</span> said he, somewhat abashed,
<span class="tei tei-q">“that your father was very sick, and his mind greatly impaired.
There was no foundation whatever for his unhappy
suspicions. Obey your uncle like good children,
and you will find him all I have represented him to
be.”</span> He then retired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was too young and ignorant of the ways and wiles of
the world, to suspect that this priest had been all along in
collusion with Magistus, and was to share with him in the
plunder of the orphans of his friend.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The words of my father rang in my ear and continually
haunted my mind: <span class="tei tei-q">“He is a thief and robber, and
addicted to magic.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I asked my uncle one day, in a very quiet manner, his
opinion of magic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He looked at me severely and answered:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What are the words of Moses on the subject?
Listen: <span class="tei tei-q">‘A man or a woman that hath a familiar spirit,
or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death. They
shall stone them with stones.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This did not convince me that my father was in error.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Months passed; and a gradual and saddening change
was creeping over our life and its surroundings. I had
detected no robbery, no magical practices; but I had no
faith in my uncle. Cautious and reticent as he was, he
could not conceal some of the ugly points of his
charac<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ter. He was violent and cruel in his dealings with his
slaves. He was addicted to falsehood, and in both opinion
and practice was destitute of charity. His strict observance
of the ceremonial law and his intense ritualism,
could not conceal from me the fact that his heart was
wholly untouched by the spiritualizing influences of true
religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He ceased after a while to take us to see our aunt.
Our teachers in various branches were not re-engaged,
or were dismissed. Education came to a stand-still.
Company was excluded from our house. His own was
opened at night to suspicious characters. By bribing
one of his servants one dark night, I obtained admission
to his courtyard, and discovered, by muffled sounds of
music and dancing, that a bacchanalian revelry was
going on underground. He sometimes betrayed the
next day, in his face and manner, the effect of these
midnight orgies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the mean time my beautiful sisters pined, neglected
and sorrowful. Magistus rarely visited them; and when
he did, he was guilty of coarse familiarities which shocked
and repelled them. I summoned courage, boy as I was,
on one of these occasions to reproach him bitterly for
these things; for neglecting our education, our dress, our
manners, our comforts; and for falling himself into habits
which would certainly lead to the ruin of us all. He
stared at me insolently, and said that I had better get
my father’s friend Caiaphas to revise his guardianship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like a man who sits helpless in a boat without oars,
gliding down a swift current, and hears the far-off but
inevitable cataract, I contemplated the dark future that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>awaited us. I grieved for my sisters more than for myself.
We had just been mourning together one day over
our sad fate, when Magistus came into the room. He had
held a long private interview that morning with a strange
man of gigantic size and very coarse manners, whose appearance,
as he entered the guest-chamber, excited my
gravest suspicions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You complain so bitterly,”</span> said he, looking reproachfully
at me, <span class="tei tei-q">“of the general decay and ruin into which
everything about here, animate and inanimate, is falling,
that it is surprising you have not yet intimated your
doubts about your father getting his proper supply of
provisions.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no, uncle!”</span> said Mary, tenderly, <span class="tei tei-q">“you could
not forget so sacred a duty as that. Surely no one ever
hinted such a thing. The thought of it would drive me
mad.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I wish you to satisfy yourselves perfectly upon that
point,”</span> he continued, in the tone of a man who thought
himself aggrieved. <span class="tei tei-q">“A trusty servant is to convey to him
a basket of things the day after to-morrow. Let Lazarus
accompany him. Let his daughters send some little
presents. His son can see him and even speak with him
at a distance. He can see his lodging and satisfy himself
that he is comfortably situated.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Without confessing, uncle,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“that this visit
is necessary for my faith in your attention to my father,
I concede that it will give me very great pleasure.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How long will he be gone?”</span> said Martha.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is there no danger?”</span> said Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He will run no risk and will return the same
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>night,”</span> said Magistus, answering both questions in a
breath.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This visit occupied our thoughts continually, and we delighted
to imagine what joy it would give our poor father.
I was out of bed before daylight that morning, impatient
to start. I partook heartily of an extempore breakfast
which Ethopus provided me. That personage to my
surprise seemed sad and abstracted. I could say nothing
to him, however, for Magistus was present. I kissed
my sisters good-bye at the door of their room, for they
too could not sleep for excitement. Magistus waved
his adieu at the front door. I walked through the courtyard
with Ethopus, who carried a covered basket on his
arm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were near the gate, when Ethopus coming close to
me slipped something into my hand. It was a long,
thin, bright dagger. I concealed it immediately in my
bosom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ethopus thinks there will be danger,”</span> said I, to
myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would perhaps have said something, but I observed
the porter admitting a person through the gate, whose
entrance at that hour in the morning caused me the
greatest surprise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was a woman; and at the age of sixteen a woman
occupies a great deal of the field of vision before the masculine
eye. This woman was very young—not more
than fifteen, although perfectly mature. She was very
beautiful—so beautiful that everybody must have turned
to look after her. Her eyes were large, soft and hazel;
her hair brown and wavy; her cheeks blended roses and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pearls: her mouth small and curved like a bow; her
voice and smile perfectly bewitching—all that I took in
at a glance: nor did it need the splendid ear-rings and
brilliant necklace and scarlet robe she wore, to impress
it very deeply on my mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She bade me good-morning with the sweetest smile
imaginable, and with the affable, self-possessed manner
of a woman much older than herself. Startled and
abashed, I could do nothing but bow profoundly and
hurry into the street where Ethopus had given the basket
to the person who was to be my guide.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I made signs to Ethopus, by a kind of pantomime we
had acquired, to keep a watchful eye on my sisters. He
replied by an affirmative motion of the head and a deep
sigh, which was evidently on my own account.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This woman was destined, under the leadings of Providence,
to make a greater and more lasting impression on
my soul than all others. And this was our first meeting:
I a bashful boy; she a strange woman, too gaudily
dressed, entering my father’s house at a strange hour.
So two ships might pass each other on the Great Sea,
merely exchanging signals of good-morning—ships destined
long afterward to convoy each other beyond the
Pillar of Hercules into the infinite unknown!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This woman was Mary Magdalen.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With my thoughts fluctuating between the extreme
beauty of Mary Magdalen and the danger which
Ethopus seemed to apprehend, I walked some
distance without regarding my new companion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I did so, I was surprised and puzzled at his
appearance. He was a young man of singularly handsome
features, the only drawback being a nose which was
a little too aquiline. His black hair curled in short ringlets
close to his head, and his face was thoroughly bronzed
by sun and tempest. His dress was rather that of some
foreigner attached to an Assyrian or Egyptian caravan,
than the coarse and simple clothing of a Hebrew servant.
And then there was something bold and free in his bearing,
which precluded the idea that he was a menial either
in character or condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are you engaged in my uncle’s service?”</span> said I.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He shifted the heavy basket from one arm to the other,
and made no reply.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I repeated my question in a louder tone; but he did not
seem to hear me, looking straight ahead at the road before
him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This handsome fellow is both deaf and dumb,”</span> said
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>I to myself. <span class="tei tei-q">“My uncle has a curious passion for silent
people.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Debarred the pleasure of conversation, I relapsed into
reverie. I determined to make a use of this visit which
my uncle little anticipated. I resolved to approach my
father boldly, contagion or no contagion, and have an
interview with him. I wanted to tell him of the neglected
and unhappy condition of his children, of our increasing
repugnance to Magistus, and of the indifference or treachery
of Caiaphas. I wanted his advice. He could surely
direct me to friends in the city, whose assistance might
arrest our impending ruin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Made happier by that resolution, as if it had already
accomplished something, I let my mind revert back to the
woman I saw at the gate, and a new cause of uneasiness
arose as I reflected upon that accidental meeting. Boyish
and inexperienced as I was, I discovered something in the
dress and manner of the early visitor, which whispered to
me that she was not a suitable companion for my sisters.
She certainly was not a domestic. Who could she be?
What could she want at our house just after daybreak?
Perhaps she came to see Magistus on business. It was not
the hour or the place for that. Perhaps she was one of
the midnight revelers whom I heard singing and dancing
in the basement story of my uncle’s secluded residence.
That idea startled me more than all. I determined to get
back home by rapid walking before nightfall, and explore
this disquieting mystery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We had passed over hill and dale through a highly-cultivated
country, full of vineyards and gardens and
orchards, full of sweet little villages and beautiful rural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>villas. This did not last long, and we turned in a south-easterly
direction. The villages disappeared; the houses
became more sparse and humble; the trees became more
stunted and bare; the rocks larger and the road more difficult.
At the point where the highway leads down the
steep hills toward Jericho and the plain of the Jordan, my
guide turned suddenly due south into a rough, barren and
wild country, where there was no road at all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sounds of life faded behind us. Vegetation almost
wholly disappeared. No animals were to be seen but a
few goats far away browsing among the rocks. The birds
seemed to refuse to accompany us further. The silence
of the desert fell gradually upon us. This was the wilderness
of Judea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were winding downward to the Salt Sea, that great
watery waste, in whose silent deeps Sodom and Gomorrah
lie buried; on whose shores stand bleak and desolate
mountains full of sulphur springs; the gloom without the
glory of nature; the home of wild beasts and lepers and
robbers and demons; mountains fearful in their nakedness
and solitude; evil genii guarding in stern silence the
eternal sleep of the lost cities of the plain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I grew uneasy and melancholy as we approached these
famous and dangerous places. The taciturnity of my
guide, together with an increasing shadow on his expressive
face, magnified my apprehensions almost into fears.
I felt my boyish weakness and inexperience by the side of
this strong, rough, silent man of the wilderness, who now
seemed to my excited imagination to have got into his
native element, and to be a part of the lonely and supernatural
region into which we had entered.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our attention was suddenly drawn to a neighboring
eminence by sounds of so strange a character, that it was
impossible to say whether they were animal or human.
Four lepers appeared in sight, almost naked, holding up
their long, withered arms, and screeching out from their
hoarse throats and swollen lips their hideous cry,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unclean! unclean!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I trembled at this sad spectacle and gazed intently,
expecting and afraid to recognize my poor father in the
group. My guide suddenly laid his hand upon my shoulder,
and we both stood still. He then set the basket upon
the ground, made signals to the lepers to approach, and
drew me away from the spot. A horrible chorus of guttural
thanks came up from the leprous creatures, who
awaited our departure before pouncing upon the acceptable
present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, sir!”</span> said I, resisting my guide, and forgetting
that he was deaf and dumb, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have given my father’s
food to those unhappy wretches! Where is my father?
Oh, take me to him!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He stopped and looked me full in the face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh yes!”</span> I continued, in a supplicating tone; <span class="tei tei-q">“that
basket has food and wine for my poor father, the leper,
and a bouquet and a letter from Martha, and a pair of
sandals from little Mary—”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Overcome with emotion I burst into tears.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The guide drew a deep sigh; and when I looked up
into his face it was radiant with a sweet and benevolent
expression. He had either heard me or he comprehended
intuitively the nature of my distress. He shook his head
and made a deprecating gesture with his hand. He then
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>drew me off strongly, but so gently that I was partially
reassured, and walked meekly at his side, overwhelmed
with surprise and sorrow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After passing over several rough ridges we turned into
a deep ravine. The guide made me go in front. The
pathway down this narrow gorge, this cleft between two
mountains, was rough and dangerous. There were deep
holes or pits upon one side, and frightfully overhanging
rocks upon the other. It was so dark and precipitous in
some places that I could scarcely believe we were not
descending into the bowels of the earth. We suddenly
emerged from this monstrous fissure on a little mound
made by the soil washed down from above, and found
ourselves on the shore of the Dead Sea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had never seen such an expanse of water before, and
was charmed with the sight. Away to the left was the
plain of the Jordan and the sacred river of that name,
invisible at a distance among its reeds and rushes. Opposite
arose the reddish-brown mountain chain which borders
the sea on the west. Far down to the right stretched
a range of high hills of a bluish gray color. In front,
and widening away to the south, lay the mighty surface
of the sea, shining like a burnished mirror in the noon-day
sun. A fine breeze was blowing; but there was
only a faint ripple on the water, for its heavy salt
waves can scarcely be stirred by the wind—like the soul
of a wicked man, which cannot be moved by the Spirit of
God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was recalled from that delicious reverie into which
every one is transported by a view of the sea; for my
guide pointed to a clump of stunted trees or rather large
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bushes near the beach. Half hidden by them was a tent
of alternate white and red canvas, in front of which a
large boat was drawn up on the sand. Two rough-looking
fellows lay in the boat asleep. There was no human habitation
anywhere about this lonely spot. These people
belonged on the other side of the sea. They were ready
for flight in a moment. They were wild, roving, secretive,
fugitive. They were engaged in some unlawful business.
I had fallen into the hands of robbers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These disquieting thoughts passed through my mind as
we approached the tent. Hearing our footsteps on the
sand, the chief came out of it. He was tall and sinewy,
a man of unusual weight and size. He was clad in a
richly-embroidered crimson robe, with a splendid scimitar,
jewel-hilted, at his side. A long beard, stained of a
golden yellow by some vegetable dye, gave him a grotesque
and never-to-be-forgotten appearance. All this
barbaric ornament did not prevent me from recognizing
the strange, coarse man who held the long interview with
Magistus two days before. Then he was disguised; now
his character was apparent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We stood before him. My guide made a low obeisance
and said in a clear voice:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Barabbas! I have obeyed your orders!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My astonishment on discovering that my robber-guide
was neither deaf nor dumb, was turned into another channel
when Barabbas exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well done! Bind him tightly with the old Persian.
If Beltrezzor’s ransom does not arrive by sunrise, we will
make way with them both together.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My uncle had betrayed me into the hands of the
Ish<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>maelite to be murdered. There could be no doubt that
the atrocious assassin had taken every precaution to prevent
escape or failure. Resistance was impossible. There
were four men in sight, either one of whom could have
overpowered me in a moment. My heart sank in despair
when my guide led me behind the tent, and bound me
securely to a little tree, without evincing the least remorse
or care at his own part in this shameful and cowardly
transaction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I now surveyed my fellow-prisoner, who was tied to
another tree close to me. His gray hair and beard showed
that he had passed considerably beyond the meridian of
life. He had a serene and rather handsome face, full of
thought and benevolence. Young and inexperienced as I
was, I perceived by a kind of intuition that my companion
in distress was a cultivated and superior man. He wore a
rich Eastern robe and a bright-colored turban. He was
smoking a long pipe curiously carved and twisted. He
surveyed me quietly and nodded kindly to me, evidently
pitying my childish terror and despair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We shall be murdered to-morrow!”</span> I gasped.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I learned a proverb in India,”</span> said the old man.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Brahma writes the destiny of every one on his skull.
No man can read it”</span>—and watching his smoke fade into
air, he slowly continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“and even the gods cannot
avert it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was astonished at his coolness; but his fatalism did
not console me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“To die—to die!—to leave my poor sisters unprotected
and to see them no more—Oh, it is horrible!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not to be,”</span> said the Persian, in a voice of singular
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>depth and sweetness, <span class="tei tei-q">“not to be is better than to be; and
not to have been is better than all.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In spite of myself and my fears, the calm and almost
spiritual halo which seemed to surround this strange old
man, began to quiet my agitation and to divert my
thoughts from my impending fate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are you a philosopher?”</span> said I.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I think,”</span> he replied; and drawing a long whiff from
his pipe, he illustrated his remark by lapsing into a profound
reverie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I contemplated this serene philosopher a long time in
silence, and made up my mind that he must have a good
many beautiful things to think about as he sat there,
bound and under sentence of death, smoking so placidly
upon the arid shore of that dreadful sea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When he indicated, by knocking the ashes from his
pipe, that he had ascended from the ocean of dreams
into which he had dived, I asked him how he had fallen
into the power of these miscreants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Speak evil of no one, my son! Leave wicked names
to the wicked. These gentlemen live upon the road and
in the wilderness. They pay special attention to travelers,
to caravans, and to small and remote villages. They cure
some people of that chronic disease we call life, and they
permit others to ransom themselves by large quantities of
that evil thing we call money. They have set me down
in the latter class, and I am awaiting a remittance from a
friend in Jerusalem.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Suppose your friend is dead, or absent from the
city, or cannot raise the sum required, or refuses to
do it?”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He pointed to the sea, shrugging his shoulders, and
exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is written, is written.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When it was quite dark my guide of the morning
brought us a little food. The old Persian ate heartily,
but I could barely taste it. The guide whispered in my
ear, <span class="tei tei-q">“Be silent and wakeful,”</span> and departed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now sleep, my son,”</span> said my philosophic companion;
<span class="tei tei-q">“trust in God and sleep. Our angels and good
genii befriend us most powerfully when asleep. When
awake we scare them away by our villainous thoughts.
Sleep.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whispered words of the guide had inspired me
with a vague hope, and I preferred trusting to his advice
rather than to the invisible guardians of our sleep. I was
therefore silent and wakeful. The moon went down long
before midnight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hours passed away slowly, slowly, marked only
by the coming up of the white stars from behind the
eastern hills; while the long minutes were told by the
dead plash of the water against the beach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were feasting and drinking and singing in the
tent of Barabbas. This was kept up until long after midnight.
Then there was silence, and the loud snoring as
of some one in a drunken sleep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It became very dark. The voices of man and nature
were hushed. The hours passed, and all things seemed to
sleep except the stars which continued to climb the heavenly
dome, and the sad, gray sea which pushed feebly
against the desert beach, and myself cruelly orphaned
and betrayed, thinking alternately of home and death.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Death at sunrise!”</span> I exclaimed, thinking aloud to
myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The sun has not risen,”</span> whispered the Persian.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Hope, the undying consoler within us, took courage
at the words of the old man and at the slow-footed
pace of the night; and thought it was long, long till the
morning, and that the angel of Life might still come, and
relieve from his awful watch the angel of Death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An hour more of silence that could be felt, and of unutterable
suspense—and a hand was laid softly upon my
shoulder. The rope that bound me was disengaged, and
my deliverer drew me stealthily along the beach, and
away from the tent where Barabbas lay dreaming of
plundered caravans and cruel uncles who enriched him
for the murder of their nephews.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The guide did not speak until we stood on the mound
at the mouth of the great ravine, where the Dead Sea
first broke upon my sight.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You are free,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are a child, abused
and betrayed. You shall not be murdered. Robber as
I am, there is something in my heart which is touched by
your sorrows. Go back to life, if not to happiness. God
perhaps will deliver you from Magistus, as He has through
me delivered you from Barabbas.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come with me,”</span> said I; <span class="tei tei-q">“leave this wretched and
dangerous life in the wilderness. Share our fate and fortune
in Bethany.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do not speak of it,”</span> he answered; <span class="tei tei-q">“it is impossible.
Hasten on your journey, or all may be lost.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> said I, clinging to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Barabbas will kill
you when he finds I have escaped.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No! I have contrived against that. I am cunning
and I shall succeed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The poor old Persian will be murdered!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No! He will be ransomed to-morrow. Away!”</span> he
continued excitedly; <span class="tei tei-q">“a moment’s delay may be fatal.
Away!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Stay!”</span> said I, eagerly; <span class="tei tei-q">“tell me the name of my
benefactor, that I may repeat it in my prayers.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have no name, no home. I am the Son of the
Desert.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He hurried softly away toward the tent, and I crept up
the ravine in the darkness.

Afraid of the dark and fearful gorge, full of
rocks and pitfalls and unseen dangers; afraid of
the unpeopled desert which awaited me above;
afraid of wild beasts, serpents, lepers and evil spirits;
afraid of the silence and solitude of night by the Salt Sea;
afraid of all things behind me and all before; I ascended
cautiously and painfully the narrow path, if path it might
be called, praying to the God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, for protection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I, who had never been out of my father’s house at that
hour of the night in my life, thus found myself amid a
complication of circumstances which might have appalled
the stoutest heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had ascended two-thirds of the way, when my keen
ear caught upon the night-wind the subdued but rough
voices of several persons who were descending the ravine.
My heart stood still and I almost fainted with affright.
Fortunately, I remembered that I had just passed, a little
lower down, a large side-fissure or chink in the great rock
wall of the ravine. I went back with the utmost speed
and caution, and got safely concealed in the black crevice
before the objects of my terror came along.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They were no doubt some of the party of Barabbas,
who were returning with or without the ransom of the old
Persian. They were talking of ransom with oaths and
laughter as they passed. I held my breath in suspense;
nor did my heart recover its natural beat until they had
descended a good distance, and their voices floated faintly
upward like the mutterings of lost souls in some horrible
abyss.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was now afraid to start again lest I should meet another
detachment of the robbers. I waited a long time,
listening intently. It suddenly occurred to me that when
the robbers reached the tent of Barabbas, my escape would
be discovered, and the swiftest runners despatched to overtake
me. This thought brought the cold drops to my
forehead; and I hurried breathless all the way up the
ravine, actually thinking that I heard the footsteps of men
behind me, and voices calling my name.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Escaped from the robbers, I fell into the arms of the
desert. I could have extricated myself from the new
danger if the sun had been shining. But the day rose
dark and cloudy, and I could not tell whether I was
going east or west, north or south. I failed to recognize
any of the spots we had passed the day before. I walked
rapidly up and down the bare hills, over the rough gullies
and through the sandy hollows. After some hours of this
exhausting travel, both mind and body being on the stretch,
I was shocked on discovering that I had been moving
in a circle, and was near the mouth of the ravine again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would have stretched myself upon some rock in
despair; but my dangerous proximity to Barabbas and his
men, revived my fears and gave supernatural strength to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>my body. I fled away as fast as I could over new hills
and gullies and sandy bottoms. It must have been two
or three hours after noon, when I reached a hill overlooking
a deep, narrow valley, the dry bed of some nameless
brook, which, in the rainy season, poured along over the
sands its little tribute to the sea. Thoroughly exhausted
with hunger, thirst, fatigue, loss of sleep, fear and despair,
I lay down upon the hillside. Lost in the wilderness,
thinking of the still worse conditions of my father and
sisters, my misery was too deep for tears. A strange
torpor crept over my senses, and I fell into that profound
slumber in which the weary are strengthened and the sorrowful
comforted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I awoke, the setting sun, just freed from clouds,
was shining in my face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How life-giving, faith-giving, hope-giving is a sight of
the sun, wrapping his mantle of softened glory about him,
and descending trustfully to sleep in the kingdom of night,
assured that Aurora will open duly her palace of pearl,
and his golden chariot with its fiery steeds issue forth in
the morning!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So does the Soul sink only to rise; sleep only to wake;
die only to live: ever changing in state, ever the same in
substance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was thus drawing new vigor from the rays of the
sun, when a voice of heavenly sweetness broke upon my
ear, a voice chanting this beautiful Scripture:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“As the hart panteth after the water-brooks,</span></div>

</div>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are there angels as well as demons in the desert?”</span>
said I, to myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A jutting brow of the hill concealed from me the source
whence these sounds appeared to issue. I arose and advanced
to explore the mystery. Rounding the intervening
slope, I saw a young man seated upon a stone at the mouth
of a large cavern. His quick eye detected me in a moment,
and he advanced to meet me. He wore a single
garment wrought of the finest camel’s hair, which was
secured about his waist by a leathern girdle. Simple
toilet! But when you looked at his fine head with its
long black hair curling about his bare neck, and his beautiful
oval face soft as a girl’s, full of all saintly thoughts
and heavenly emotions, you knew that you were in the
presence of one who was clad interiorly in fine linen and
purple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Good sir,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“behold an unhappy youth, who
has just escaped death by robbers, and is lost in this
terrible wilderness!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One must have lived long in the desert to find his
way out of it such a dark day as this. It will be clear
to-morrow, and I will pilot you into the great highway.
Meantime you are welcome to my poor hospitalities—a
cave for roof, a bed of skins, water to drink, wild honey
and locusts to eat; that is all.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I gladly accept your offer; and were your proffered
gifts still more humble, they would be sanctified by the
light of brotherly love you throw upon them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I seated myself on the stone while he went into the cave
and brought forth his simple food and drink, of which I
partook heartily.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“To whom am I indebted for this kind reception?”</span> I
inquired, as I finished my meal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am John,”</span> he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of Zacharias;
and I dwell in the desert until the time of my showing
unto Israel.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A deep human groan from the interior of the cavern
now startled me, and I sprang from my seat.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is that?”</span> I exclaimed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My poor old patient has awakened. I must go and
examine him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He takes in the sick as well as the wandering,”</span> said I
to myself. <span class="tei tei-q">“Surely the angels must protect him in some
peculiar manner.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John came forward again with an anxious countenance.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“the old man has rapidly changed.
He fell into a soft slumber an hour ago, but he is now
plainly dying. I knew he was very ill, for he has raved
all day about his children and some magicians who wish
to destroy them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At these words a fearful tremor seized me. I could not
speak. I sprang past the young man, and in a moment
was kneeling at the side of my father! I seized his withered
hand and covered it with kisses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My father! my father! Do you not know your son,
your only son?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The young hermit looked on in tears.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man slowly opened his eyes and cast a bewildered
look, first at me, and then at John.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—you are angels,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“who have come to
welcome my spirit into paradise.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He breathed heavily. I sank down weeping. John
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>came forward with a little basin of water. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no
time to be lost,”</span> said he in a low tone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you believe in God, and in Moses his lawgiver,
and in the prophets his servants?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I do! I do!”</span> said the old man, eagerly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you repent of your sins, and pray for the Holy
Spirit to guide you?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I do! and God be merciful to a miserable sinner!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then I baptize you with water, the emblem of purification,—and
in the name of the Lord, the only God, into
his spiritual Church and into the hope of immortal life.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus saying, he sprinkled some water on the old man’s
forehead. His own face shone with a meek and holy
radiance. My father closed his eyes and seemed to sleep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly he started, frowning, as if some great pain
had changed the current of his thought.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tell my son to beware of his uncle. He is a magician.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here is your son!”</span> I exclaimed, eagerly; <span class="tei tei-q">“here is
your son! Oh, speak to me, my father!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He did not notice my grief; but, pointing slowly to
John the Baptist, he said, solemnly:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the prophet of God!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He then looked fixedly upward; and as I followed his
glance to the roof of the cave, his spirit passed away
beyond the blue dome, beyond the stars and the sun,
beyond the entire realm of nature, into the paradise of
Moses and the prophets.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I spent the night in prayer and tears by my father’s
dead body. Occasionally the young prophet broke in
upon the stillness of the air with his silvery voice, chanting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the sweet verses of Scripture. I was sorely tempted to
rebel against the providence of God, which permitted
such a good man as my father to be so cruelly dealt with.
The presence, however, of the young prophet, was in
itself a sermon, a blessing, a help to resignation. One
could not be skeptical or even critical in his luminous
atmosphere of peace and love. I reflected that there
were many great mysteries which my youthful and inexperienced
mind could not at present comprehend, and
returning faith assuaged the grief it could not remove.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next day about noon the young prophet offered a
prayer over the corpse, and we consigned it to a humble
grave dug by our own hands in a large cavern near by.
I observed that there were four other graves in the same
spot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said John, meekly, <span class="tei tei-q">“this is my little cemetery.
Here I bury my dead in ground consecrated to the Lord.
This was a robber who was wounded in a fray and left
by his comrades. He dragged his bleeding limbs into
the desert. I found him and bore him to my home. I
preached to him the new gospel of repentance and faith,
and he died in my arms weeping like a child over the
sins of his youth. He who occupies that grave was a
madman, who broke his chains, and drove every one
from him with knives and stones until he met me in the
wilderness. He followed me to my cave, and would sit
contented at my feet hearing me sing or read or pray.
Under that mound is a poor slave who fled, mutilated
and frenzied, from a cruel master. I kissed the wounds
I could not heal; and he died clasping my hands smilingly
to his lips. And that last one is the grave of another
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>poor leper like your father, forsaken even by his wretched
companions—but not forsaken by the Lord, whose Word
I obeyed when I tended him in his long <span class="tei tei-corr">illness.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I call it consecrated ground,”</span> he continued; <span class="tei tei-q">“for
these poor people are the children of God. The leper is
cured of his leprosy; the slave is free; the madman is
sane; the robber is forgiven.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What induces you,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“to lead this strange,
lonely life, so full of self-sacrifice, so full of terrors and
dangers?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Spirit of God!”</span> he said, solemnly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are you not afraid of the silence, the solitude, the
darkness of the desert?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He replied in the words of Scripture:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall
I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life: of whom
shall I be afraid?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I felt awed in the presence of this young man, who was
not more than ten years older than myself. I was better
satisfied to leave my father’s ashes in his keeping, than if
I had built above them the most splendid monument of
Pentelican marble or Corinthian brass.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After a frugal meal we started for the public road. It
was ten long miles to the nearest highway, and it was ten
more from that to Bethany. We discoursed, as we walked
along, about spiritual things; and although I did not understand
half he said, he spoke with such eloquence and
sincerity that he convinced me he had some great mission
in the world. We parted a little before sunset with mutual
embraces and blessings. I dropped some grateful and
admiring tears as I gazed after the heavenly-minded
her<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mit, picking his way with his long staff through the rough
places, until he disappeared from sight over the brown,
bare hill.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not until the comforting and sustaining power of
his presence was withdrawn, that I recognized how exhausted
and helpless and lonely I was. Fatigue, fear,
excitement, sorrow, loss of sleep and inadequate nourishment,
had considerably shattered my nerves; and now to
appear suddenly in the presence of an uncle who thought
he had murdered me, was a difficult and perhaps a dangerous
task. I would gladly have turned in any other
direction; but my sisters were in the power of the monster
who had plotted my assassination. Nothing but a vague
fear that those lovely women were in some trouble or distress,
gave strength to my tired limbs and courage to my
aching heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Night came on, and I had to advance more slowly.
The full moon was shining halfway down the western sky,
but a dark cloud had risen from the ashes of the sunset,
and was advancing upward. It was important that I
should make all the haste I could, before the light of
the moon was obscured by that ascending blackness.
To get out of the road might be to lose the whole
night.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I moved so rapidly that I became exceedingly tired.
If I sat down to rest, a mysterious fear impelled me
to rise and press forward to Bethany. I have faith in
those secret attractions, those silent monitors, those inexplicable
warnings. A minute’s repose of muscle, a minute’s
recuperation of breath, and I started again with renewed
energy.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A wind came up behind the cloud and drove it furiously
onward. It covered the moon and all was dark.
I groped my way. I stumbled over obstacles. I advanced
slowly. It was late, late in the night, when I
entered the village of Bethany. No lights were visible;
no sounds were heard. I traversed the streets alone. I
passed my uncle’s residence, brimful of maledictions
against its wicked proprietor. Soon my father’s house
loomed up before me. I saw the long white wall in
front of it, and the parapet of the house-top darkening
above.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly a strong blast of wind stirred all the trees of
the village. It sighed along the deserted streets and up
into the sky. It lifted the lower edge of the cloud from
the moon which shone out, low down, just above my
father’s house, as it were with a sudden brilliancy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It revealed to me two astonishing things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One was a large, strange, gilded vehicle drawn by two
powerful horses standing before the gate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other was the figure of a woman on the house-top,
between me and the moon—a woman with flowing robes
and disheveled hair, raising her arms wildly to heaven,
while a man was approaching her in the attitude of
striking.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was my sister Martha!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With a cry of horror I sprang against the gate, which
gave way before me.

I am too deeply impressed with the vanity of our
worldly affairs in comparison with the verities
of the spiritual life, to employ my own time or
engage a reader’s attention with a biography, however
pleasing or romantic, unless there was a subtle connecting
link, which I expect to reveal, between the facts narrated
and those eternal truths which overshadow all others in
importance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I, alone of all mankind, have lived consciously in
both worlds long enough to discover their relations to
each other. What my fellow-men have seen only on the
surface, I have examined interiorly. I have seen the
secret springs of human pride, ambition, passion and
folly. I have seen the souls of men as they appear in
the sight of angels. And my instructions in that world
were all based upon my experiences in this.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is now necessary to drop for a while my personal
narrative, and to go back and relate, from the evidence of
others, what happened in Bethany during my absence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters had been left with our atrocious uncle, like
two lambs under the guardianship of a wolf. One capable
of assassinating his nephew, a mere youth, would not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hesitate at any wickedness against his beautiful nieces.
This man’s character was so cruel and wicked, that some
explanation is needed of the singular maturity of diabolism
to which he had attained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus had neither religion nor honor. Honor binds
us in duty to our neighbor, as religion binds us both to
God and the neighbor. It is a moon which shines brilliantly
in the absence of the sun. The light of honor is
also but the reflected light of religion. When both shine
together, honor is absorbed and swallowed up in the more
effulgent blaze of religion. The soul without religion or
honor, is like the earth without sun or moon—cold, dark,
desolate, hideous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the soul of Magistus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Irreligion, like drunkenness, is sometimes inherited.
The father of Magistus was a scoffer and sensualist.
Fatal incubus of moral deformity descending from father
to son! In this he was typical of the age. The hereditary
pressure toward hell was so great, that a few more
centuries of transmission would have brought the world
into perfect sympathy with the lower regions. The advent
of the Lord arrested that for a while.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Without religion or honor man is very close to hell.
The veriest barbarian has some faint idea of natural religion,
and some feeble impulse of natural honor, which distinguish
him from the beasts and unite him to his kind.
These are barriers against the influx of infernal life. He
is ignorant of the devils within him, and the devils within
him are ignorant of him. Wise and blessed provision!
Were he brought into conscious rapport with his own
attendant evil spirits, he would soon be one with them.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Their life in hell and his life on earth would be animated
by the same breath.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This had happened to Magistus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not that he was a barbarian. He was an educated,
cultivated man, accustomed to the luxuries and full of the
suavities of civilized life. Civilization and religion are
not synonymous. Hell itself has a stupendous civilization.
Magistus was a Pharisee by profession: a ritualist, and a
strict observer of feast-days and ordinances and ceremonies.
That, however, was not the man, but only his outer garment—his
cloak. Supposed by the world to be virtuous
and honest, this wealthy and reputable Pharisee was spiritually
a whited sepulchre, full of dead men’s bones and
all uncleanness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was a spiritualist, a sorcerer, a necromancer, a
magician. He at first sought and became familiar with
these people, with their studies and arts, from natural
curiosity. It was very pleasant to call up his dead father
and various dead friends, and converse with them. It was
agreeable to know that they were all happy, and advancing
in various degrees toward the infinite divine perfection.
They showed him wonderful things. They performed
miracles in his sight greater than those which the magicians
of Egypt performed before Pharaoh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then they told him that the Jewish Scriptures were not
divinely inspired, but a medley of fables, passable poetry
and childish philosophy. He had already suspected this;
and he congratulated the spirits on possessing a critical
genius so similar to his own. He finally acquired, from
these supernatural instructors, a grand system of
philoso<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>phy, revealing the divinity of nature and the laws of
progress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having become convinced that there are great and
subtile powers emanating from the spiritual world, unknown
to most men, he determined to avail himself of
those powers for his own private ends. He became a
secret pupil and disciple of magicians and wizards. He
communicated with spirits and permitted them to take
possession of him, soul and body, so that they spoke
through his mouth and wrote through his hand and came
at his call.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He learned all the tricks and spells of legerdemain,
the arts and formulas and incantations of magic, and the
rites and ceremonies of the black art in its broadest sense.
He obtained means of seeing objects at any distance, of
producing hallucinations or optical illusions, of personating
the dead, of finding hidden treasures, of reading
men’s thoughts, of sowing enmity between friends, of discovering
secrets, and a thousand other astounding and
almost incredible things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The soul is not destroyed in a moment: it is the work
of years. The evil spirits and demons with whom he was
thus brought into contact, slowly poisoned the fountain-head
of character; extinguished his reverence, his modesty,
his respect for marriage; undermined his conscience;
swept away all religious and even social and
civil scruples; and fired and sustained all his evil propensities;
so that, externally a faithful disciple of Moses,
he was interiorly a devil, governed only by the love of
self and the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This formidable hypocrite, the most of whose wealth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had been obtained by secret frauds, and was not unstained
with blood, had his dwelling in the centre of an immense
area surrounded by lofty walls and concealed by a dense
grove of trees. He received no visitors but those who
came to him at night, and for no good purpose. He had
the character of a recluse, devoted to sacrifice and prayer.
He thus indulged his secret vices and carried on his diabolical
incantations unsuspected. The dark shadows of
his princely mansion enveloped a degree of Assyrian
luxury scarcely exceeded by the Caprean court of the
emperor Tiberius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Caiaphas, the priest, was his best friend, who shared
his private pleasures and maintained by constant applause
his public reputation for sanctity and honor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The influence of evil spirits who possess us is at first
gentle and subtile, coinciding with our own inclination.
Thinking to lead, we are led. When a man is chained
so that he can no longer resist, they urge him headlong
to a crisis. They fire his evil passions; they blind his
perverted intellect; they inflate his pride and self-conceit;
they make him scornful and regardless of others, impatient
of all barriers to his self-gratification, and assure
him of boundless immunity and protection. In this state
of horrible fantasy and inflamed passion, he is ready to
trample upon all laws human and divine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this fearful point in his spiritual life had Magistus
arrived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When my father was driven into the wilderness, Caiaphas
and my uncle plotted together how to get speedy
and sole possession of his great wealth. To get rid of or
destroy his children was the first, and, indeed, the only
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thing necessary. But they resolved to allow some months
to elapse—to let our misfortunes die out from the public
memory, and even ourselves be quite forgotten. Hence
the seclusion, the solitude, the systematic neglect to which
we were subjected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plan was finally matured. The boy was to be decoyed
into the wilderness and murdered by Barabbas. It
was to be given out that he was a wild, incorrigible lad,
who had run away from home and joined a band of
robbers. After a few months a letter was to be received
from Barabbas, whose fame as an outlaw was widespread,
giving the particulars of his death in an attack of the
party upon some caravan. This was to settle the matter
for ever in the public mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was more difficult to dispose of my sisters than of
myself. A hundred schemes were suggested by the inventive
villains, but all rejected or suspended. It was
finally agreed to draw them out and test their characters,
to make experiments upon them, to see what could be
done with them. It was a delicate task; but Magistus
had boldness and cruelty for anything, and Caiaphas was
to back him incessantly with his private counsel and his
public support. He had already begun his insidious work,
by lamenting to sundry influential persons, with sanctimonious
regrets, that the daughters of his old and dear
friend exhibited so early a singular perverseness of character
and disregard of their social and religious obligations.
The result, he added, of that laxity of discipline
and passion for individual liberty, which characterized the
unhappy leper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first and best instrument of evil is always a woman.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Mary Magdalen, left an orphan without relatives at a
very early age, had fallen into the hands of a strolling
showman, who taught her to sing and dance, accompanying
herself on the timbrel. Her extraordinary beauty
attracted attention in the streets of Jerusalem, and she
soon passed into the possession of one of those connoisseurs
who study the anatomy as well as the philosophy
of art. She quickly disappeared from sight; and it was
rumored that she had been sent to Ashkelon to serve in
the gorgeous temple of Ashtoreth, the Venus of Assyria.
She had gone one dark night no further than Bethany,
and had buried her talents and her shame in the princely
mansion of Magistus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the morning of my departure this serpent was introduced
into the dove-cote. Magistus represented her as a
distant relative whom he had invited to spend several
weeks with his nieces, hoping that her gayety of spirits
would lighten the constant gloom of his little charges.
The children, dazzled by her great beauty and won by
her free and affectionate manner, were delighted with
their new companion. She entertained them with curious
stories of what she had seen and heard, refraining from
any allusion which might reveal her true life and character.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the plot of the two arch-demons did not work as
they had calculated. Indeed, it worked in a way quite
opposite to their expectations. They had counted on the
corrupting influence of a bold, fascinating woman on the
gentle and unsophisticated thoughts and feelings of innocent
girls. They had not counted, cunning and sagacious
as they were, on the possible influence of the girls upon
Mary Magdalen.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That influence was astonishing. When she felt the pure
and innocent sphere which surrounded the lovely sisters,
a change came over the subtle emissary of Magistus.
She forgot the instructions of her masters. The memories
of her old life seemed to die out, and the unseen angels
of her better nature to wake into strange activity. Young
herself, more sinned against than sinning, her pity was
awakened for these young creatures against whom such
wicked ones were conspiring.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She made them tell her all about their poor father, and
wept with them at the story. She took them into the
garden and played over the green knolls, and ran in the
graveled walks, and gathered flowers, and sang little
childish songs, as if she were a child again. She asked a
thousand questions about our mother and little Samuel,
and about the babyish sayings and doings of my little
sisters and myself. She frequently exclaimed <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, I am
so happy! This is the happiest day of my life! Oh that
I could live for ever so!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pausing before the tomb of my mother, and looking at
a little vase of fresh flowers which stood before it, she
suddenly fell upon her knees, exclaiming wildly:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“O God! if I could have offered flowers, also, at
the tomb of a mother, it might have been different!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She burst into a flood of tears; and the sisters endeavored
to console her—not knowing the true nature of her
wound—by kissing her cheeks and mingling their tears
with hers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They were interrupted in these sweet offices of mutual
sympathy, by the voice of a servant asking Mary Magdalen
if she had forgotten that she had to prepare herself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and her companions for the grand supper at the house of
Magistus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She arose from the ground, and slowly recovering her
composure, led the astonished children through the gate
in the garden wall toward the house of our uncle. On
the way she told them that Magistus had prepared a
handsome entertainment for herself and them, and as a
charming surprise to their brother, who was expected to
return with good news from the father just about the hour
of the feast. They need not be frightened, for Caiaphas
alone was to be present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We had never entered any portion of our uncle’s great
mansion except the small wing which contained the reception-room
and the long passage which led to the
private chamber of our invalid aunt. The three women
now passed up a flight of marble steps into a portico
leading into a vast hall, ornamented with statues and with
vases filled with flowers. Hurrying through this hall,
Mary lead them up another flight of stairs which had a
gilded balustrade, into two exquisite bed-chambers which
opened into each other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The bedsteads were of carved ivory, exceedingly beautiful;
the canopies, of blue silk fringed with gold; the
coverlets, of fine linen and purple, curiously embroidered.
The divans, the couches, the chairs, the tables, were all
gems of graceful art. The floor was of polished cedar,
with gilded moulding around the wall. The ceiling was
a splendid stucco-work on which scenes were painted in
brilliant colors; in one room, Actæon peeping from behind
the trees at Diana and her nymphs in their crystal
bath; and in the other, Venus beating her breast and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tearing her hair at sight of the blood-stained thigh of
Adonis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole atmosphere was freighted with the most
delicious and exhilarating perfumes. There were chests
of drawers full of the richest female clothing, the fruit of
the rarest material and the finest needlework. There were
caskets lying open and revealing ear-rings and necklaces
and bracelets of the most dazzling beauty. The sisters
were overwhelmed with wonder and delight. They had
never seen such things before; for our father, rich as he
was, was plain, frugal and unostentatious in his tastes and
habits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These are all ours,”</span> said Mary Magdalen, <span class="tei tei-q">“the gifts
of our good uncle who delights to make us happy.
Come, let us dress for the supper.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Domestics came at her call, and the ladies were attired
in robes of the greatest magnificence. Their hair was
dressed in the most graceful manner, sparkling with alternate
flowers and gems. <span class="tei tei-q">“All this is for Lazarus,”</span> said
the sisters to each other, as they followed Mary Magdalen,
blushing at themselves, down into the supper-room in a
deep basement almost under ground.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The supper-room was as gorgeously furnished as the
bed-chambers. The table was placed on a raised platform
at one end of the room, leaving a great space for
which our bewildered visitors could not imagine the use.
The ceiling had a splendid painting of Aurora driving the
chariot of the sun, attended by the Muses and the flying
Hours. The walls were adorned with solid upright mirrors
of polished brass. In every niche and corner was
some exquisite marble, some nude figure from the Grecian
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mythology; the most beautiful of which was Leda caressing
the swan, concealing within its white form the passionate
soul of Jove.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Caiaphas and Magistus reclined upon silken couches at
a table which was loaded with savory viands and vessels
of gold and silver containing delicious wines, and ornamented
with brilliant vases of fruits and flowers. The
scene was lighted by hundreds of wax candles of as many
colors as the rainbow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As soon as the women were handed to their places at
the table, Martha exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And why could not poor aunt Ulema be brought
down to enjoy this charming feast?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Mary added:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And Lazarus, where is he?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ulema and Lazarus were the last persons in the world
whom the host would have invited to his banquet. He
paid no attention to Martha’s question. To Mary’s he
replied by drawing a parchment from his bosom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Listen!”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“a letter from Lazarus!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The faces of the young girls grew anxious.

Magistus looked up: the sisters were weeping.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I was half angry at first,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“at this strange
disobedience. On reflection, I am satisfied. It confers
immense happiness on both father and son; and their
consultations may be of great service to you all. And,
besides, it gives me such a good opportunity to become
better acquainted with my charming nieces.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He passed the manuscript to my sisters, who inspected
it <a name="corr071" id="corr071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">closely.</span> It was my handwriting without doubt. The
reader need not be told that it was a base forgery; for at
that very moment my poor father was ill in the cave of
John the Baptist, and I was bound in expectation of death
on the shore of the Salt Sea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters appeared to resume their composure and the
feast proceeded, although they partook very lightly of its
delicacies. Musicians came in, and the harp, the timbrel,
the flute, the cymbals, the drum, and the silver bugle
enlivened the entertainment. Caiaphas and Magistus grew
warm and witty and convivial over their wine, which they
pressed in vain upon the timid girls. Even Mary Magdalen
merely sipped it in deference to both parties.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What a delicate thermometer is the heart of a young
girl! Without thinking, how innocent! Without reasoning,
how wise! A thoughtful shadow crept over Martha’s
face. Mary sank into a deep reverie, from which the
playful sallies of the rest could not arouse her. These
young girls were thinking, and their thoughts ran in the
same channel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sudden change of Magistus from indifference to
suavity; this gorgeous and secluded feast; Lazarus and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his father away off in the wilderness; their poor aunt shut
up in her sick chamber; this strange woman who wept so
bitterly in the garden: these pagan pictures and statues
so revolting to their chaste religious instincts: the lights;
the music; the noisy laughter of these usually sedate men;
all these things overwhelmed them with sudden apprehensions
and vague terror. Each divined the feelings of the
other by some secret sympathy; and bursting into tears
at the same moment, they both rose from their seats.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Stay!”</span> exclaimed Magistus, nourishing his wine-cup
and maddened by its contents—<span class="tei tei-q">“Stay! you lose the cream
and essence of the feast. I will show you now how the
dancing-girls of Babylon intoxicate the king of Assyria.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At these words they fled from the room.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Follow them,”</span> said Caiaphas to Mary Magdalen,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and quiet their apprehensions.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Put your babies to bed,”</span> roared Magistus, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
come back yourself.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will not describe the new parties who were introduced
to the feast, nor how it degenerated into a revel, and the
revel into an orgy. Mary Magdalen did not return to the
supper-room; and long after midnight the drunken master
of the house was borne off to a sleep from which he
ought never to have awakened, and to dreams of conquests
which he never achieved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The shadow of other spheres more powerful than his
own, was already approaching to thwart his plans and
change his destiny!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An hour after all was quiet, a strange sound was made
at the back gate in the wall nearest the lodging-rooms of
the domestics of the establishment. It was a double
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sound; the first part of it being a loud and peculiar
whistle, the last part a powerful and startling hiss or
rattle. The first sound seemed to summon some one to
appear; the second, to threaten him if he did not obey.
The first was a call; the second a menace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was one person on the premises, and only one,
who knew the full meaning of that strange summons. He
trembled on his couch when he heard it. Great drops
of sweat came out on his forehead as he listened. He
strove to rise as if to obey it, but fell back as if paralyzed
with fear. The call was twice repeated with a weird
ferocity in its tone; and the black eunuch, Ethopus,
staggered from his chamber and groped his way into the
open air and to the gate. He opened it softly with a
private key, and stepped into the street. Do not men,
like moths, fly sometimes stupidly into the candle of
danger?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A remarkable vehicle, drawn by two great black horses
and driven by a hideous black servant, stood in the street.
It was showily gilded, and had several little doors and
windows in it. It resembled the chariots on which mountebanks
and jugglers perambulated the country, but was of
larger size and more tastefully constructed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus paid no attention to this equipage. Right before
him stood an object capable of inspiring him with
the deepest horror. It was a tall figure with a huge yellow
serpent coiled about his neck and body, and a leopard
standing quietly at his side. The leopard growled and
the serpent hissed as the black man approached their
master.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be quiet, Moloch!”</span> he said to the leopard. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hush,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Beelzebub,”</span> he whispered to the snake. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is a friend
and fellow-servant.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The poor black prostrated himself in the dust before
this mysterious night-visitor and his bestial attendants.
He signified his total submission by raising the man’s
foot and placing it on his head as he groveled on the
ground. When he released it, he kissed it with the most
abject servility. His abasement was extreme.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That is right, Ethopus!”</span> said his master, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is
right. I rejoice to find you in such a becoming frame of
mind. Conduct me promptly to the secret chamber of
magic. Then return to my servant and give him suitable
accommodations. Inform Magistus of my arrival early in
the morning. I have come on a grand errand to this
village of Bethany.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus obeyed these orders without noise. All was
at length silent. Perhaps all slept: the drunken proprietor,
the wicked priest, the remorseful Magdalen, the
frightened eunuch, the strange guest, and Mary and Martha
locked in each other’s arms, their beautiful faces
bathed in tears, and their sweet souls dreaming that their
angel-mother was watching them from heaven.

a man struck speechless in the course of disease,
yet retaining his mental faculties. Death perhaps
approaches; weighty business presses on his mind;
solemn secrets demand revelation; confessions of soul
struggle for utterance. He makes inarticulate sounds,
incomprehensible gestures. He writhes; he moans with
the burden of thoughts he cannot express. His eyes
speak and plead with a mute eloquence. His ideas play
upon his countenance like lambent lightning, but die away,
voiceless, indefinite, unrevealed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the state of Ethopus, the dumb eunuch, the
day after the treacherous banquet. There was a great
solitude about the house; for Magistus, Caiaphas, and
Simon Magus the magician, made an early and prolonged
visit to Jerusalem. Mary Magdalen took the sisters over
the beautiful and extensive grounds, and paid another
visit to the tomb of our mother, carrying some exquisite
flowers in her own hand as a little offering to the maternal
shade. Ethopus flitted about here and there in a state of
unaccountable excitement. He followed the sisters all day
at a respectful distance; and when his duties called him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>off imperatively, he went precipitately about everything
until he could assure himself again that they were free and
out of danger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ethopus has something extraordinary on his mind,”</span>
said Martha, to herself; but she did not communicate her
observation to her timorous and sensitive sister.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The case was evidently this: Ethopus had discovered
the plot of Magistus against us all, and he felt certain that
the arrival of the magician boded no good. He was
struggling between his disinterested affection for us and
his intense fear of his wicked masters. He felt his own
weakness, increased by his inability to speak; and he was
laboring to devise some plan by which the sisters could be
brought to share his knowledge, and to concert measures
of escape from some impending catastrophe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He seemed to divine that Martha was more thoughtful,
courageous and trustworthy than her sister. It was late
in the afternoon when he made her a signal, seen by herself
alone, to follow him. She understood his meaning,
and contrived to withdraw without exciting the suspicion
of her companions. Ethopus conducted her to the chamber
of Ulema. Scarcely giving her time to exchange
kisses with her aunt, he pushed her into a little recess in
the wall which was concealed by a hanging curtain. Between
the folds of this, Martha could peep cautiously into
the room. In a few moments Magistus entered.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He seemed hurried and flustered, and had a dark
frown upon his brow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No message from Barabbas to-day. Something has
gone wrong. Put this woman to sleep immediately.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus adjusted a large mirror of polished metal on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a table. Ulema arose from her couch without speaking
a word, and seated herself in a chair about four feet in
front of the mirror and gazed steadfastly into it. Magistus
stood a little one side, and made rapid passes with his
hands and arms from her head to her feet, nearly touching
her body. His black eyes were fixed fiercely upon her
face, and his heavy breathing could be heard by Martha
at every pass he made.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was silence for several minutes, during which
Ulema gazed steadfastly into the mirror. Martha could
not help doing the same; and she gazed at the mirror
until a strange, tingling, bewildered sensation began to
creep over her frame, and she averted her eyes to escape
its magical fascination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The victim of this singular experiment now became
rigid, and made a convulsive sound as if in a severe
spasm. Martha was terribly frightened; but her aunt
suddenly became relaxed with a profound sigh. Magistus
took a long needle and passed it through the skin of
her hand. She did not flinch. He then put something
which seemed to be a lock of hair into her palm, and
closed the fingers tightly upon it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Follow this person,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“wherever he is, and
tell me what you see.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The woman began, after a long pause:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am in a great wilderness of bare hills full of rocks
and sand. The sense of solitude is terrible. It is cloudy
but windy—and the sun will soon shine in the west.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But the youth?—the youth?”</span> cried Magistus, impatiently.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wait a moment. The youth? I must find him.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Bless me! how he has wandered! how many circles!
Ah! there he is! I see him stretched at full length
upon the ground.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That is good!”</span> said Magistus eagerly; <span class="tei tei-q">“that is good.
He lies dead upon the ground. Go on.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He is not dead,”</span> said the oracle slowly; <span class="tei tei-q">“his heart
still beats: he sleeps.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not dead?”</span> screeched the old man, <span class="tei tei-q">“what say you,
not dead? Is he not wounded? Is he not stabbed? Is
he not bleeding?”</span> he continued in the highest excitement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No!”</span> said the woman calmly; <span class="tei tei-q">“he is not dead, he
sleeps.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you see no gashes upon his body?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, I see only a bright new dagger.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Furies!”</span> exclaimed Magistus; <span class="tei tei-q">“he has escaped me.
I have been deceived.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Turning suddenly upon the woman, he seized her by
the throat:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you tell me the truth?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I tell you what I see. I fabricate nothing. I am
now attracted around the hill. Ah! I see a young man
with the face of an angel coming forth from a cave. He
sings. Oh how sweetly he sings!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Angels and devils!”</span> roared Magistus; <span class="tei tei-q">“you have
seen or reported falsely.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With that he seemed overwhelmed by a paroxysm of
rage, and began beating the poor woman violently about
the head and arms with a black rod he took from the
table. She made no resistance, and did not seem to feel
the blows. Ethopus raised his hands deprecatingly, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Martha was about to cry out from her place of concealment,
when a low, fierce growl, from underneath the floor
apparently, startled all of them but Ulema, who heard
it not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus was feeding his leopard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Master has returned,”</span> said my uncle, <span class="tei tei-q">“I will
consult him immediately. He may deliver me from this
difficulty.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He left the room. Ethopus made rapid passes from
her knees upward, and Ulema awoke. She rubbed her
hands and eyes, looked wonderingly around her and
exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have had a long, painful sleep, and I must have
seen sad things. Did I give him satisfaction?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said she, with a distressed and puzzled air,
<span class="tei tei-q">“when will this cruel imprisonment cease, and this
strange life of visions which I never remember?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Martha now came forward and threw herself weeping
upon the neck of her aunt. For a long time these sorrowful
women exchanged those kisses and tears which are
consolations. They then unburdened their hearts to each
other. By questioning Ethopus and interpreting his pantomimic
answers as well as they could, they learned that
some secret dangers surrounded them, and that Ethopus
wished Martha to spend the night in the chamber of her
aunt. Martha thought it best to rejoin Mary immediately,
and explain to her that Ulema was quite indisposed,
and get her to sleep with Mary Magdalen, and permit the
older sister to comfort and nurse the invalid. All of
which was easily accomplished.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ulema had been confined for years in that little room
by her husband as the subject and victim of his magical
art. She was a clairvoyant of extraordinary power; and
when put asleep by the shining mirror and the waving
hands, she would follow any clue given her, and the
greatest physical obstacles seemed only penetrable shadows
in the path of her mysterious vision.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She was thus employed by her husband to advance the
schemes of his unscrupulous spirit. She was made to
read the thoughts of others, so that Magistus became
possessed of any man’s or any woman’s secret life whenever
he chose. He obtained information in this manner
which enabled him to make lucrative transactions in business,
to plot in the dark against whomsoever he pleased,
to destroy the peace of families, and to acquire a reputation
for superior and almost miraculous wisdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She had long ceased to be anything but a mere tool in
her husband’s hands. She was locked up and taken care
of as any other valuable instrument would have been.
She was visited and inspected only when her services
were required. Love, sympathy, interchange of sentiments,
all this had ceased. She received nothing from
him but contempt and threats. She lived within hearing
of his midnight revels. She bore the ravages of these
things in her pale and tearful face, with its sad and
terrified expression.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus came softly into the room about midnight, and
after many gestures expressive of the supreme necessity
of caution and silence, he conducted the two women on
tip-toe through a narrow passage. Near the end of this
he paused, and pressing on a secret spring, he discovered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a sliding panel in the wall. This opened and admitted
them into a large, empty room. This room was only for
the ventilation of a more interior and secluded apartment.
A series of movable slats effected the communication
between the two chambers. The light streaming through
the shutters showed that the inner room was occupied.
Looking down through the apertures, with very little
danger of being discovered, the women beheld, six or
eight feet before them, the floor of the secret chamber of
magic.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus left them as stealthily as a cat, after placing
them in the best position to see and hear what was going
on in the den of sorcery. He pressed Martha’s hand to
his heart before he departed. Perhaps he wished to show
how deeply he felt for them; perhaps also to intimate how
deeply he suffered. Perhaps he asked for help as well as
sympathy. The poor, dumb African would not only save
them, if possible, from their subtle enemies, but would
enlist the knowledge and power of a superior race, to
effect his own deliverance from the crushing thraldom
they had imposed upon him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A thousand or two thousand years hence, magic as a
science and an art will have ceased to exist. Generations
unborn will enjoy the leafage and fruit of that sacred tree
of Christianity, whose little seed we have seen planted in
the dark ground. The hells now opened will be closed;
the superstitions now triumphant will be a myth; the languages
now living will be dead; the arts now flourishing
will have perished; the civilization now dominant will be
a historic shadow. Those who find this manuscript and
give it to the world, will not be able to comprehend the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>meaning, or to believe the truth, of the strange things
I am going to relate—and yet they are true.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magic, which pervades to a greater or less extent all
nations, and in some shape influences all individuals, had
its origin in the corruption and perversion of the sacred
truths of religion. It is the life of all false systems, the
voice of their oracles, the inspiration of their prophets,
the power of their mighty men. It was the medium by
which evil spirits took possession of their victims. It is
the falsity which antagonizes truth; the darkness opposite
to light; the hell arrayed against heaven. To be under
magical influence, is to be assaulted, betrayed, possessed,
governed, by demons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus, who believed himself attended by Moloch
and Beelzebub, two princes of hell, under the respective
forms of a leopard and a serpent, was the most
remarkable sorcerer in the time of Christ. He was a
Samaritan by birth, but had spent his youth in Egypt,
where he became addicted to the black art, and <a name="corr082" id="corr082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">thoroughly</span>
conversant with all its mysteries. He was supposed
by most men to be an Egyptian, and he took no
pains to correct the mistake.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was a man of unquestionable genius and boundless
ambition. He was of majestic presence, bending weaker
spirits easily to his will. He was brave to desperation,
and eloquent as if he had been fed in his youth by the
bees of Attica. He was the secret chief and leader of
thousands of persons addicted to magic in different countries.
His word was regarded as law; his power as irresistible;
his wisdom as inscrutable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magicians generally resorted to remote caves and
de<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>serted ruins for their rites and incantations. Many of the
most splendid temples, however, of the pagan religions,
had private chambers devoted to their use. So also did
the palaces of many kings, and the princely mansions of
wealthy and powerful men. The magicians of Jerusalem
and its neighborhood had a secret council-room in the
quiet house of Magistus, in which they held their infernal
conclave at every visit of the Master.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two women peeped cautiously into this chamber
of mystery. The floor and the ceiling were both covered
with black cloth, the latter having a great many stars
flaming upon it in imitation of night. Through them a
vast comet trailed its fiery form. The walls were painted
with figures of the most disgusting objects which creep on
the earth, or fly in the air, or swim in the sea. Some of
these figures had the heads of men and women: others
had the heads of monsters attached to naked bodies in
the human shape.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On a raised platform of black marble, and in a great
arm-chair covered with crimson silk, sat Simon Magus,
wearing a white robe of dazzling lustre, a leopard skin
loosely thrown over his shoulders, and a gilt crown surmounted
by an eagle with outspread wings. He wore
also a massive gold chain around his neck, from which
was suspended a little sapphire image, which was supposed
to guide the Egyptian priest to the truth, as the
breast-plate of precious stones did the Jew.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The short black hair of Simon Magus curled close to
his head, and he had no beard after the fashion of his
adopted country. His forehead was white as pearl and
both wide and lofty. His eyes were large and brilliant.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>His whole face was illumined by the grand fires of intellect
and passion. His expression was too proud to be
pleasing, too fierce to be beautiful. He was a man to
strengthen the heart of his friends, and to make his enemies
tremble.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A large black table was before him, brilliantly painted
with the signs of the zodiac. In the centre of it stood an
image or idol made of black stone or ebony, having the
head of a man, the breast and fore-feet of a lion, and the
hind quarters of a goat. The serpent was coiled on the
platform at his right hand; the leopard crouched at his
left. A splendid globe of crystal hung from the ceiling
constituting a lamp, burning perfumed oil and shedding a
rose-colored light over the scene.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this mystic and formidable presence stood twelve or
fifteen men with bowed heads, down-hanging hands, and
attitudes of the deepest humility. The women recognized
only the faces of Magistus and Caiaphas. The former
stood nearest to the table. Simon was addressing them
in terms of reproachful eloquence:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You have made no progress in our sublime mysteries
during the past year. You have acquired no new powers
over the spiritual world. You have not even given me
information of the least importance. Alas! you are devoid
of genuine ambition, without which whoever deals
with spirits becomes a slave and not a master.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His voice became more sonorous and his eye more
scornful as he warmed with his subject:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your tastes, your character, your life, are low and
vulgar and sensual. You employ the powers of magic
for paltry and contemptible ends. To obtain reputation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for cunning and foresight; to get good bargains out of
your neighbors; to cheat some widow out of her property;
to find stolen or buried treasure and appropriate
it to yourselves; to pry into the secrets of men’s bed-rooms
and store-rooms and kitchens; to seduce silly
maidens; to create trouble between husbands and wives;
to inflict all kinds of petty and scurvy revenges upon your
enemies,—that is all you do with our venerable and awful
art. The grander destiny which awaits us all by the development
and centralization of our powers, your vulgar
passions do not permit you to see or to appreciate.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My example has been almost in vain. My spirit of
self-sacrifice in achieving my lofty ends, is a mystery to
your sluggish and ignoble souls. I have endured hunger
and thirst and wakefulness and nakedness and heat and
cold and solitude and plagues and wounds for mastery in
the great path I have chosen. I have traversed the world
from the frozen seas to the chasms of torrid heat. I have
contended with wild beasts and with their guardians, the
great spirits, by land and water. I have conquered the
serpent and the leopard. The vulture lights on my
shoulder like a sparrow; the lion crouches at my feet
like a dog. Arch-demons come at my bidding, and
hundreds of lesser spirits swarm at the signal of my
curse.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He became violently excited; his eyeballs glared
around in frenzy, and he continued in a fierce whisper:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It would freeze your cowardly souls only to hear the
spells, the incantations, the blasphemies I employed; the
watchings, the tortures, the combats, I endured, before I
brought Moloch and Beelzebub into subjection to my will.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>See there, how I have burned their names into my flesh
with pencils of iron heated to whiteness!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He turned back the sleeves of his robe from his white
arms, and held them out. Upon one arm in great red
letters was the word Moloch, on the other the word
Beelzebub.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It was dreadful! dreadful!—but henceforth they are
mine.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The serpent writhed and protruded his tongue. The
leopard showed his white teeth, but dropped his yellow
head between his paws.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have told you,”</span> he continued, scornfully, <span class="tei tei-q">“what
constitutes your ambition. Now I will tell you mine. To
me belongs the glory of having organized magic and associated
magicians. I found them a horde of wandering
hunters; I shall make them an invisible phalanx of soldiers.
I have more than two thousand magicians, in
seven different countries, who obey me as one man. By
concerted action we have obtained the secret history, the
hidden life of all the governors, consuls, warriors, kings
and great men throughout that vast region. I am maturing
my plans to get them all under my sovereign control.
Other conquerors operate from without, by sword and
spear and catapult. I conquer from within, by hope and
fear and lust and passion and terror. Unseen, unsuspected,
unknown, with legions of invisible soldiers, I shall
get possession of all their treasures, all their palaces, all
their thrones!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not see it?”</span> he exclaimed, wildly, starting
to his feet. <span class="tei tei-q">“The lever which truly moves the world lies
always on the spiritual side of our life. I advance from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the right quarter to my designs. I shall subdue the souls
and bodies of men. I shall possess myself of all they
possess. I shall become emperor of Rome—yea, monarch
of the world. Further still:—I shall advance from
realm to realm, from sphere to sphere in the spiritual
universe, marshaling around me my hosts of conquering
spirits. I shall pronounce the Unspeakable Name. My
own name shall become Unspeakable!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the magician’s imagination soared away in this
flight of boundless ambition, his form dilated; a fierce
red flush came over his face; his eye, fired with a baleful
brilliancy; and the maniac stood forth the very impersonation
of that Self-Love which is the moving and controlling
genius of hell.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His hearers trembled at his words and manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He sunk back into his chair and leaned his brow upon
his hand. No one disturbed his reverie. All were spellbound
by the speaker’s enthusiasm. After several minutes
he raised his head and continued in a subdued
tone:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But, alas! my friends! this glorious dream is far from
accomplishment. If we had only to conquer the race of
men, the difficulties would not be insuperable. But our
fiercest fight is on the spiritual side. All are contending
for the same prizes—power and glory. When we have
beaten back the shining ones whom they call angels, our
combat begins with each other; for each demands all for
himself.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yet I despair not”</span>—he added, after another pause
and with a certain sadness in his manner—<span class="tei tei-q">“I despair
not of realizing my inexpressible dream. I have come
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into possession lately of an ancient and wonder-working
formula, whereby I hope to take many steps forward.
Listen!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I discovered by secret means only to be acquired in
Egypt, that in a certain wild spot of the Lybian desert
one of the oldest and greatest cities of the world was
buried in the sand; a city so old that it has no historical
record; a people inconceivably wicked, in comparison
with whom the people of Sodom and Gomorrah were
children sporting in the golden dawn of innocence. This
city and these people had been overwhelmed by the same
Power which buried the cities of the plain in the Salt
Sea.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I found this spot. By the aid of spiritual powers I
burrowed my way into their buried palaces and temples.
I exhumed their remains. I made food and drink of
their ashes. The spirits who accompanied me fled away,
and I was left alone. I blended my being with that of
the lost people. I became a skeleton among skeletons, a
shade among shades. I conquered. I drew voices out
of the silence, forms out of the darkness, life out of death.
I summoned with difficulty and danger the ruling spirits
of the perished race. I mastered their master. I made
him my slave. I compelled him to disgorge the secrets
of the wilderness and the grave. I have enriched myself
with treasures of knowledge and power, of which no man
even dreams.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Intense excitement pervaded his listeners—fear of the
man and stupefaction at his words.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will show you,”</span> he continued—<span class="tei tei-q">“by a strange art I
have acquired, I will show you this new demon who is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>also one of the oldest. I have summoned this antediluvian
monster to-night. He stands before me face to
face, like man to man. You cannot hear his voice nor
see his shape; but you shall feel his presence and mark
his shadow on the wall.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He now let down a large white curtain against the wall,
to the top of which it had been rolled like a great map.
He resumed his seat and drew forth a curious cup from a
drawer in the table. It had words and figures engraven
upon it. He gazed intently into the cup, and pronounced
some words in an unknown tongue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A moment of awful silence ensued, every one gazing
steadfastly at the curtain and hearing the beating of his
own heart. Suddenly a strange, benumbing, <a name="corr089" id="corr089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">paralyzing</span>
sensation invaded the nerves of all present. It was the
approaching sphere of the antediluvian spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“See!”</span> said the magician hoarsely, <span class="tei tei-q">“See! He
comes!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And sure enough! Like the shadow of a man which the
moon makes when it is going down, there crept a shadow
up over the curtain; dim, wavering, misshapen, which
slowly settled into distincter form, and stood with bended
head and sweeping beard, with tottering knee and outstretched
arms, like a very old man of gigantic size
begging alms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All shuddered at the presence of this terrific spirit, more
than Saul at the rising of Samuel in the cave of the witch
of Endor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“From this most ancient arch-demon of our art,”</span>
continued Simon, pointing to the shadow, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have
ex<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>torted a method of incantation which promises more
power and glory than all the combined rites and amulets
in the world. He will confirm what I say.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The shadow slowly turned its old and hideous face
toward the audience and made an affirmative motion with
its head. It then passed away from the curtain like the
shadow of a cloud creeping over a field of grain. All
breathed more freely.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This formula will procure me a liquid of such potent

raising his voice and confronting his cowering audience,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<span class="tei tei-q">“Has your oracle directed you where to find this wonderful

child, born at the death of her mother.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These were the last words heard by either Ulema or
Martha. These affrighted women had been the silent
witnesses and auditors of the extraordinary scene I have
described. With increasing amazement and terror they
found themselves unable to stand, and they sank softly
upon the floor. When the object of Simon’s visit to
Bethany began to reveal itself, they trembled with intense
fear. When the horrible idea took distinct shape in her
mind, Martha had almost burst into a wild shriek of
agony. The shriek was with great difficulty suppressed.
The terror and agony were borne in upon the young soul,
and she fell into a long and fearful swoon which seemed
death itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After a long, long time, when all was still and dark,
Ethopus approached as softly as he had departed. He
aroused Ulema from her trance of grief, and the two bore
the unreviving form of Martha back to the chamber. She
was laid upon the bed; and as Ethopus passed out of the
door, Ulema saw him by the dim light of the stars lifting
his face and hands earnestly to heaven.

After Martha came out of her swoon, the night
was spent in consultation between the two women
as to the surest method of averting the catastrophe
which impended. It was determined that the sisters
should escape from the house early in the morning, and
appeal for help to some worthy and influential residents
of Bethany, friends of my father. They were so sure of
obtaining succor and deliverance, that they became quite
cheerful as the sunlight broke above the hills.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus suddenly entered the room, and their hearts
sank within them as they noticed the silent ferocity of his
countenance. Without saying a word he clasped iron
rings upon their ankles and wrists, and chained them
securely to the bed-posts. Their tears, cries, inquiries,
supplications, were all in vain. He took no notice of
them whatever, and locked and bolted the door behind
them, leaving them bound and in despair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A different but equally painful scene occurred in the
chamber of Mary Magdalen. Mary, my sister, had just
awakened with a deep sigh, and began narrating an ominous
dream which had disturbed her night’s rest, when a
loud knock was heard at the door, and a strange voice
commanded them to dress and come forth immediately.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>They sprang up in great trepidation and obeyed the order.
On opening the door they turned back into the room with
a loud shriek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus stood before them with his serpent and
leopard. He had these creatures about him almost constantly.
It was to keep them in good training, for his
personal protection, to excite wonder, to inspire awe,
and to enforce his authority. They were admirable adjuvants
to his pretensions and power. Every one quailed
before them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He assured the women that his pets should not hurt
them, if they followed him in silence, turning neither to
the right nor to the left. There was no alternative but
to obey. He conducted them to our father’s residence
through the gardens and the gate in the garden wall. He
had given every point a recent inspection. He passed
into the inner courtyard, and led them down a flight of
steps to a room in the cellar used by two of the domestics
as a bed-chamber. Here he locked and bolted them in
and retired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus were the sisters secured without the possibility of
communication or escape. The conspirators took every
possible precaution. No one was permitted to leave the
grounds, or to come in during the day. Magistus or
Simon kept the black eunuch continually in sight.
Whether his agitated and anxious manner betrayed him,
or whether the magician really read his thoughts, his
masters suspected that Ethopus meditated a revolt against
the snares which had fascinated the leopard and the serpent.
He was closely watched.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The situation of this poor fellow was very touching.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>His dark face was an index of a darkened soul, not by
evil but by the absence of light. Under his homely exterior
was a brave and generous heart. He was born and
reared in a barbaric land, full of strange beasts and birds
and stranger men, where Nature herself is wild and savage.
He had been the victim of incredible oppression and
cruelty. It is wonderful that the last spark of human
feeling had not been trodden out from his spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It spoke well for the native richness of the soil when
good seed sprang up so luxuriantly as soon as planted.
From the day he became acquainted with my sisters and
myself, a new life had dawned upon him. Friendly
voices, gentle words, kindly looks, sympathizing deeds,
were food and drink to his amiable and child-like nature.
His soul grew and expanded under them as flowers under
dew and sunlight. Sincere attachment to us and hatred
of our common enemies took possession of the whole
man. He was ready for any labor, any danger, any
sacrifice in our behalf.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Imagine the mental tortures of this humble and voiceless
friend, when he saw the terrible fate which was impending
over us, and found himself so helpless to avert
it or to assist us!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus passed away the long, dreary, gloomy day—the
day of my father’s funeral. It was spent by my sisters in
prayer and tears and unavailing struggles to escape or to
make themselves heard. Mary Magdalen identified herself
thoroughly with the gentle and innocent child with
whom she was imprisoned. She taxed her ingenuity to
the utmost to give her consolation and hope; and when
invention failed, she resorted to tears.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you ever pray to God?”</span> said little Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“To which God?”</span> asked Mary Magdalen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Which God? There is but one God!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Magistus has the statues of a dozen gods and goddesses
in his house; and he says that all of them answer
prayer when they are presented with splendid gifts.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah, the only God,”</span> said the child with sweet
solemnity, <span class="tei tei-q">“heareth the prayer of the humble and contrite
heart. He heareth the poor and needy, and lifteth
up all who are cast down.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How beautiful!”</span> exclaimed Mary Magdalen with a
deep sigh; and she fell into a profound reverie with
downcast eyes, while a solitary tear, the first pearl of
genuine repentance, trickled down her cheek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About nightfall Simon Magus unlocked the door and
called Mary Magdalen out of the room. He closed the
door behind her, so that Mary could not hear what he
said. He put into her hands two cups of different patterns
containing milk.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This one,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will give to the child; this
you will drink yourself. Be careful and not forget. Your
life depends upon it. If you fail to obey me, I will feed
your body piecemeal to my leopard.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Terror-stricken as well by his manner as his words,
she took the cups mechanically from his hands and
passed into the room. He carefully locked the door
again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bewildered by this new blow, she took her seat in
silence, a cup in each hand. She strove to collect her
thoughts. Poison to Mary or death to herself! That
was the alternative. Her nature was impulsive and
pas<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sionate. She reached her conclusions quickly, and she
acted upon them instantaneously.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is my wretched life worth in comparison with
hers?”</span> was the silent language of her heart, <span class="tei tei-q">“What attraction
has life for me, poor, guilty, forlorn, forsaken
thing?”</span> She drank from the cup intended for Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What is the matter,”</span> said my sister, who had noticed
her singular abstraction and agitation. <span class="tei tei-q">“What are you
drinking?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Only some milk. I was so frightened by that terrible
man that I forgot what I was doing. Excuse me for
drinking first. Here is a cup for you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The unsuspecting child drank it eagerly, having passed
the whole day suffering from both hunger and thirst.
Taken after fasting, poisons act quickly. It was not long
before Mary Magdalen began to have strange swimmings
in the head and benumbing sensations along the course
of all her nerves. She felt sure that her death was
approaching.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mary,”</span> said the brave girl, <span class="tei tei-q">“when you are delivered
from these dangers and your brother comes home and I
go away, will you remember me sometimes?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will not go away.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh yes. I shall go away, far, far away.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You shall live with us always,”</span> said Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot! I cannot! When I am gone, and they tell
you evil and cruel things of me, will you think of me
kindly and love me still?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will not believe them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But if you should believe them, would you love me
still? I cannot live without your love.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will love you for ever,”</span> said Mary, throwing her
arms around her neck. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do you speak so sadly?
You frighten me. What is the matter?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am sleepy, so sleepy,”</span> said Mary Magdalen, stretching
herself on the couch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary knelt at her side, chafing her hands, with some
vague foreboding rising on her mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh do not go to sleep so early. Do not leave me
alone in the dark. Talk to me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mary,”</span> said the stupefied woman slowly and with
difficulty, <span class="tei tei-q">“does Jehovah who accepts the offering of a
contrite heart, ever receive into his heaven a very great
sinner?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly, certainly!”</span> said the child.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then pray for me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No words, no shaking, no supplications, no frantic
screams could arouse her again; and Mary beat her
bosom and tore her hair in the extremity of grief at the
side of her inanimate friend.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
About an hour before midnight four men stood in the
inner courtyard of my father’s house. Caiaphas and
Simon Magus were engaged in earnest conversation.
Magistus turned to the black mute whom he had compelled
to accompany him everywhere, and said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I shall go half a day’s journey with Simon. We will
start now in ten minutes. Haste to the stables where his
chariot and servant are in waiting. Drive quietly around
to the front gate of this house. Here is the key to
Ulema’s chamber. After we have gone, not before, give
those women some food.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus departed. He left the gate in the garden wall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>open. He hurried to Ulema’s room. He released the
astonished women. He drew them out upon the <a name="corr099" id="corr099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">gallery.</span>
He pointed eagerly to the garden gate and over to my
father’s house. It was all he could do. He was wild
with excitement, and the gestures of the dumb man were
those of despair. He then ran toward the stables.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The women started on their dangerous journey, not
knowing what was to be done. They hurried along the
flowery walks in the greatest trepidation. On ascending
our terraced garden, Ulema, weak, sick and overwhelmed
with emotion, fainted and fell. Martha tried in vain to
revive her. Time was flying. Faint screams now issued
from the house. Mary was being abducted! She started
up and without thinking,—for thought would have paralyzed
her efforts,—rushed to the rescue alone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The miscreants had descended into the cellar. Great
was their astonishment to find Mary Magdalen in a profound
stupor and the little Mary weeping at her side.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This delays us,”</span> said Simon, with great vexation.
<span class="tei tei-q">“That traitorous woman has taken the opiate herself.
It will be necessary to bind and gag the little one. No
sounds must issue from the chariot, no suspicions be
excited.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was during this terrible process of binding and gagging
that the screams were made which Martha heard in
the garden. It was effected; and the three men were
bearing the silent and muffled body through the courtyard,
when Martha rushed toward them with a loud
shriek of supplication.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Silence!”</span> thundered Simon, <span class="tei tei-q">“would you betray
us?”</span> And uncoiling his great serpent from his neck
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>(the leopard was locked up in the chariot), he threw it
toward her. <span class="tei tei-q">“Strike her!”</span> he said, in a hissing tone.
The serpent, as if acting intelligently, made an immense
coil of its body and raised its head threateningly toward
Martha. She fled in terror up the stairway leading to the
flat top of the house.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pursue her!”</span> said Simon to Caiaphas—<span class="tei tei-q">“pursue her
and keep her silent with your dagger until we have
escaped.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Caiaphas bounded after her. She turned and faced
him on the house-top. He threatened to plunge the
dagger into her heart if she made a sound. She backed
before him to the parapet. It was at that moment when
the moon, suddenly emerging from the cloud, revealed
to me, as I was approaching my father’s house, the two
figures; my sister raising her arms wildly to heaven,
and the wicked priest threatening to strike.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At that moment I entered the courtyard and confronted
Magistus and Simon, who were bearing my sister toward
the gate. I drew the dagger Ethopus had given me, and
plunged it into the side of Magistus who was nearest to
me. He sank upon the ground with his burden, uttering
a deep groan. Simon rushed upon me and in a moment
we were engaged in a deadly struggle. He was a man
of astonishing strength. He threw me at last upon the
ground and had nearly wrested my dagger from me,
when Ethopus who had been concealed behind the gate
sprang to my assistance. He dragged the magician back
by the shoulders, and at the same instant there was a
loud scream from Martha on the parapet, and the sound
of voices and footsteps at the gate. Two persons rushed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in to our aid; and Simon suddenly springing from us all,
escaped into the street, and in a second the wheels of his
chariot rattled away with the utmost rapidity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Caiaphas, seeing that his party was vanquished, fled
away through the garden to the house of Magistus. Martha
hurried down and rejoined her friends below. Ethopus
brought lights as quickly as possible, although I had
already recognized in the new-comers the good old Persian
whom Barabbas held prisoner, and my late deliverer
who had styled himself the Son of the Desert.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary was released from her wrappages and threw herself
alternately into the arms of brother and sister. Ethopus
enjoyed this scene with gestures of frantic delight.
The happy party was suddenly startled by the groans of
the wounded man, who had dragged himself away and
was leaning against the wall of the house, bleeding profusely.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We laid him on the floor of the reception-room, and
the Son of the Desert, who was an adept in such matters,
stanched the blood and bandaged his hurt, pronouncing
it severe but not mortal. When Magistus opened his
eyes and saw the old Persian bending over him, he stared
at him with amazement, and stammered forth:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Surely this is my renegade brother-in-law, who has
renounced the name and religion of his fathers and calls
himself Beltrezzor.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was right. Beltrezzor was our uncle, our father’s
only brother, our next of kin, our legal guardian!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This recognition gave us all the greatest delight. After
mutual congratulations we hastened to recover poor Ulema
from her trance, and to convey her and her wounded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>husband to their own home. Mary Magdalen was brought
up into an airy, upper room, and every effort was made
to rouse her from her comatose state; but in vain. A
good nurse was placed at her bedside charged to render
her every attention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Son of the Desert spent the night under our roof,
and proceeded the next morning to Jerusalem with Beltrezzor.
He refused to appear at the table with the women
and declined all the rewards and presents which our
gratitude induced us to offer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems that Beltrezzor’s friend had sent one-half of
the ransom by the robbers who passed me going down
the ravine, promising the other half in two days after, on
the delivery of Beltrezzor himself at Jerusalem. Barabbas
had entrusted the Son of the Desert with that mission.
The old man had been slow in his movements, and night
with its black cloud had overtaken them before reaching
the highway. Reflecting that the trumpets of the Roman
soldiery had sounded the evening tattoo, Beltrezzor had
luckily suggested that they should turn aside into Bethany,
where he had a brother whom he had not seen for thirty
years. They came close behind my own weary footsteps,
and I have told the result.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second day after these surprising events, Mary Magdalen
disappeared suddenly to our great regret, leaving no
clue by which she could be traced. She awoke from her
artificial sleep about daylight, and the nurse supplied her
with food, and told her the wonderful things which had
happened. She went away, notwithstanding the remonstrances
of the nurse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tell them,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I rejoice at their good
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fortune, and that I love them so much that I lift the
shadow of my presence from the sunshine of their
peace.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poor Magdalen!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My new and real uncle, Beltrezzor, had a bargain to
make with Magistus and his young friend, the hypocrite
Caiaphas. It was easily affected. We were in possession
of facts which would have exposed them both to public
infamy, and have cut short the ambitious career of the
talented priest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Silence on our part was purchased at the following
price:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor was a pagan, and objections might be raised
in the Jewish Sanhedrim to his taking possession of a
Jewish estate and the charge of Jewish orphans. Magistus
and Caiaphas were to obviate these objections, and to
secure him the legal guardianship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus was to be declared a freedman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor, my sisters and myself were to be permitted
to visit Ulema every Sabbath so long as she lived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition to his liberty, Beltrezzor presented Ethopus
with a precious stone of considerable value, upon which
was engraved a mystic name. This gem had great reputation
in the magical fraternity for releasing its possessor
from the spell of the most powerful enchantment. Whether
some change really came over his spirit, or whether his
imagination did the work, Ethopus acted as if some great
burden had been lifted from his soul. He entered at
once into our service, and his gratitude seemed only
equaled by his humility.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor took possession of my father’s estate, and to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>our great joy determined to reside at Bethany during our
minority. Under his judicious and liberal management
everything soon blossomed like the rose. He adorned
our residence with all the chaste and beautiful treasures of
architecture and art. He surrounded my charming sisters
with every luxury that the most cultivated fancy could
suggest. He devoted himself especially to our education,
and our house became the favorite resort of all that was
most learned and brilliant in Jewish society.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus several years passed happily away, overshadowed
by no cloud. If a tear ever came into our eyes, it was
consecrated to the memory of our dear father, and to the
reflection that he had perished so sadly in the wilderness,
without knowing the good fortune which was in store for
his children.

The impression made upon our minds by these
extraordinary events was ineffaceable. After
three days and nights of perilous adventure and
suffering, from a youth I became a man. From little
girls, my sisters became women. There was ever afterward
about us a pensiveness, a gravity of manner, a too
early maturity of thought, which excited the pity of those
who had known us during our father’s life, when a happy
childhood broke forth into smiles and pleasures, like a
genial spring blossoming out into perfumes and flowers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our six months of domestic life under the management
of Magistus, with its gloom, its neglect, its suspicions, its
want of love and liberty, stood in painful contrast with
the merry sports, the delightful peace and the religious
sunshine of our father’s household. It was night compared
with day. But the unmasking of the characters of
Caiaphas and Magistus was a rude shock to our tender
spirits. We had revealed to us at one view the utmost
depths of human depravity. We had stood consciously
amid the hideous and revolting spheres of hypocrisy, sensuality,
robbery and murder. There was a leprosy of the
soul as well as of the body; there were wild beasts of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the spirit; there was a wilderness of the mind; there was
a death masquerading in the garments of life; and we had
seen them all. We had looked into hell.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This early and deep insight into the fearful connection
between evil spirits and wicked men, and their combined
influence over the world, was in one sense salutary. The
recoil from the bottomless abyss into which we had
peeped, produced a rapid and unusual development of
the moral nature. In my sisters it took a religious, in
myself a philosophical turn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those young girls, constitutionally pious and full of
gratitude to God, sought renewed strength and comfort
in the exercises of faith and religious duty. They devoted
themselves to prayer and the study of the Scriptures.
With the womanly nature of the vine, which must cling
to something of firmer texture and stronger growth, they
attached themselves trustingly to the priests and scribes
and doctors of the law, with a natural and pardonable
feeling. But they avoided Caiaphas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not remember that I ever felt any decided respect
or love for the religious institutions of my country. I
was born, I suppose, with the element of veneration for
the past left out of my mental organization. I never
could understand why men look back to the infancy and
childhood of the race for the oracles of wisdom. It is
rather the business of each century to scrutinize rigidly
the inheritance it has received from the preceding century,
and to reject everything which is worthless, unphilosophical
and immature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was largely indebted to my father for my progressive
temperament. He despised pretension and ceremony.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He conformed his life rather to the spirit than to the
letter of the law. His understanding sturdily revolted
against the mysterious and improbable. We were not
trained after the strict manner of the Pharisees, but with
that freedom of action which does not crush the individuality
of the child. The reformer, the innovator,
the man of new ideas and life, is seldom born of the
narrow-minded literalist and bigot of an old system.
The father is generally an intermediate link between the
old and the new; adhering loosely to the old himself,
and prophesying, inarticulately perhaps, the emancipation
of his son from the thraldom of the past.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we get rid of the conventionalisms of an old and
perishing system, we become peculiarly open and sensitive
to the grand intuitions of natural religion. The
gorgeous ceremonies of the temple made little impression
even on my boyish fancy: they were tiresome and disgusting
to my riper years. But I melted into tender
admiration at the thought of John the Baptist, praying
and toiling in the wilderness, unseen of men, trusting in
God, and receiving to his loving bosom and care, the
leper, the robber and the lost ones of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the teachers provided me by my excellent uncle
Beltrezzor, was a Greek; and the study of that wonderful
language and literature led me still farther away from
the influence of Judaism, corrupted and failing as it was.
I was not slow to assert that the poetry of Æschylus and
Homer charmed me more than that of David and Isaiah;
and that the philosophy of Plato exceeded in value all the
learning of the Scribes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My heretical opinions, candidly avowed on proper
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>occasions, but never obtruded, had a gradual effect in
breaking the spell of enthusiasm which bound my sisters
to the priesthood and the ritual. But the examples and
conversations of Beltrezzor had a still greater influence in
lifting their minds out of that narrow and exclusive circle
of thought, in which the typical Jew is born, lives and
dies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor was a man of most beautiful and lovely
character. Simple in his own tastes and dress, frugal in
his own habits, but generous and even lavish to others;
cheerful and polite; active and industrious; truthful and
unselfish; full of liberal opinions and tender sympathies;
he charmed all who knew him by the purity and nobleness
of his mind and the suavity of his manners. One
of the most opulent and honored men in his adopted
country, and an inveterate traveler by habit, he had
quietly settled down in the little village of Bethany to
consecrate several years of his life to our education and
happiness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet the model man, the like of whom we had never
seen in Priest or Scribe, was in our eyes a renegade and a
pagan. He had abandoned the doctrines and precepts
of Moses for those of Zoroaster. His religion, which
appeared so sweetly in his life, was a puzzle to us, for we
expected to discover its quality in its outward observances.
The following manifestations of the religious spirit were
all we ever detected: He sometimes looked from his
window at the rising sun, and muttered something like a
prayer with bowed head. He always spoke of Fire with
a strange reverence, and said it was synonymous with
Power and Beauty. He kissed his hand to the first star
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he saw in the evening. On the last day of every year,
he had fruits, flowers, wine and rice brought into his
chamber, as offerings to the spirits of his departed friends,
who, he believed, visited him on that occasion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Behold the simple ceremonial upon which was based
so much goodness of heart and so much wisdom of
thought!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who was Zoroaster?”</span> asked Martha one day of
her uncle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Zoroaster, my child, was the friend and companion
of Abraham. They lived together in Haran until the
Great Being, Ormuzd, the King of Light, called Jehovah
by the Jews, summoned them both to leave their country
and fill a sacred mission. Zoroaster went to the east and
Abraham to the west. Zoroaster like Moses received the
book of God on the top of a burning mountain, and gave
laws to the people.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What kind of laws, uncle?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The essential moral teachings are as much like those
of Moses as twin sisters are like each other.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then you do not worship idols?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No—we detest them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You do not worship any of the gods of the pagan
nations?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, my child! There is but one God, Ormuzd, King
of Light. All religions come from him. Some are purer
and more perfect than others. All true prophets and
priests are his servants. False priests and magicians are
in league with evil spirits. They are children of Ahrimanes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If there is such fundamental identity, why then,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>uncle, do you prefer the religion of Zoroaster to that
of Moses?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Because its ritual is more simple, beautiful and
sublime; because its doctrines are more rational and
philosophical; because the people who believe it and live
it, are more liberal and loving and enlightened than the
Jews; because it brings the soul nearer to the Power
and Beauty of the sun.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Uncle,”</span> said Mary, affectionately kissing his hand,
<span class="tei tei-q">“are all the worshipers of Ormuzd as good and pure and
sweet-tempered as you are?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man blushed: <span class="tei tei-q">“The teachings of Zoroaster
tend to make men far purer and better than I.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sisters sank into a deep reverie. They had a
glimpse of that great world of moral light and beauty,
which lay entirely outside of the limits of the Jewish
faith. They gazed on it with wonder.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But, uncle,”</span> said Martha, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the great day of
judgment will not the unbelievers be sentenced to eternal
punishment?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the last day, my child, all the metals in the
world will melt with heat, and all human souls, living
and dead, will pass in judgment through the fiery
element. To the good it will feel like a fragrant bath
of warm milk; to the evil it will be a torrent of burning
lava. It will consume, however, nothing but the
wicked lusts of the heart. Evil will thus be destroyed;
and all men, freely forgiven by Ormuzd, will unite in a
universal chorus of love and praise.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sphere of our uncle’s life and character taught us
charity for even renegades and pagans; and the beauty
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and rationality of his singular doctrines made me suspect
that truth had temples elsewhere than in Judea. I
became fairly emancipated from the Jewish Church, and
looked for the regeneration of mankind to the ennobling
and purifying influence of knowledge, which, I believed,
would finally illumine the world with its waves of rosy
light. Beautiful and illusive dream!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters, disgusted as they soon became, with the
fanatics, hypocrites and impostors who thronged the
temple, were not ready to cut loose from the faith of
Moses or the ceremonies of the law. They deplored
the corruptions and deadness of the Church. They
shrank from the ritualists who had no religion, and from
the devotees who had no love in their hearts. They
sought consolation by looking eagerly for the Messiah,
who was to restore the sceptre to Israel and rekindle
the embers of faith and piety in the church.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Martha and Mary pondered upon all they had ever
heard or read on this wonderful subject. Born of a
virgin, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Prince of Peace, the Mighty Counselor,
the Everlasting Father,”</span> was coming in the flesh? They
delighted to search the Scriptures for traces and predictions
of his birth, his appearance and his mission.
They loved to walk in the grove of olives which crowned
the mount in rear of our house, whence they could
see the marble colonnades of the temple and its vast
roof all fretted with golden spikes, while they conversed
arm in arm on their favorite theme.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus were we being secretly prepared by the experiences
and circumstances of our life, for the reception of
the new and strange religion of Christ. The
thought<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ful analysis of the past history of any human life, will
reveal here and there the movings of the finger of God.
We do not see the divine providence as an event approaches,
but only after it has transpired. Jehovah
showed his back, not his face to Moses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some may be surprised at the idea that certain minds
were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prepared</span></span> for the reception of the Christian religion
by processes directed by divine providence. They suppose
that every one who saw the miracles and heard the
words of Christ, could have believed in him and followed
him if he had chosen. It is a mistake. There were
many noble and pious Jews, to whose minds the words
and miracles of Christ had no weight whatever; who
rejected him unhesitatingly as a dreamer or an impostor.
They were not prepared to receive him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There have been several revelations or dispensations
of Divine Truth; and there will unquestionably be more.
The new revelation is seldom or never received by the
adherents of the old. The force of the decaying system
is first broken by schism. After schism comes a spirit
of free inquiry, and skepticism is developed. The old
foundations are broken up; new ideas, new influences,
new life start forth. Then comes the possibility of a
renewed development, a reconsideration of principles,
the evolution of higher and more spiritual truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This fact was illustrated in the early days of Christianity.
The first disciples were not the leading spirits and
great lights of the old dispensation, who regarded themselves
as the special guardians of religious truth. That
class misunderstood Christ and rejected him. The men
and women who forsook all and followed him had no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>special reverence for the Jewish law and its ceremonies.
Singularly enough, they were not persons of strong religious
convictions, however holy their life became after receiving
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. They had
outlived or spiritually outgrown the Jewish dispensation.
They cared little or nothing for the opinions of priest or
scribe. They stood aloof from the Jewish ceremonial
with skeptical indifference, waiting for Providence to
give them something radically new. They knew Christ
by intuition; their spirits had been organically prepared
for his reception.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christ rejected the Jewish Church long before it rejected
him. He neglected its ceremonies; he violated
its laws; he disregarded its superstitions; he ignored
its magnates; he chose his associates from the publicans
and sinners of civil life, and his disciples from the publicans
and sinners of the moral world. If he ever comes
again, the same phenomena will recur; for the Divine
laws repeat themselves, like the return of comets and the
revolutions of the sun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was acquainted with most of the persons who organized
the infant Church of Christ. There were within my
knowledge but two exceptions to the general law, that
those who acknowledged the Messiah first and most cordially,
were outside of the orthodox pale. Thomas Didymus
was a rigid Pharisee and ritualist. He believed
nothing which he could not see with his own eyes and
touch with his own hands. He was the least spiritual of
all the disciples.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, was a man of ardent
imagination, intense faith and great genius. His mind,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>however, was cast in the antiquated mould; and he was a
stickler for orthodox observances. No logic or rhetoric,
however eloquent and convincing, could ever have shaken
him from his Pharisaic attachments. The miraculous interposition
of heaven was necessary to turn him from the
service of the Jewish Sanhedrim.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not without influence also in preparing us for the new
era, was the character of John the Hermit, afterward
known as John the Baptist. For several years we paid
two annual visits to the tomb of our father, and to the
cave of the extraordinary young man who had befriended
him in his last illness. One of these visits was made
when the angel of spring had touched the snow-wreaths
of winter with her silver wand and turned them into
flowers. The other was made when the forests of autumn
clothed themselves in their festal robes of crimson and
gold, to celebrate the approach of death with its prophecy
of resurrection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We chose one beautiful and cloudless morning, and
making an early start, mounted upon sure-footed mules,
and well provided against those demons of the desert—hunger
and thirst—we crept slowly along over the brown
hills and through the desolate hollows. Ethopus and two
or three more stout domestics always attended us as a bodyguard.
We made a picturesque party, encamping in the
mouth of the sacred cavern, startling the silence of the
wilderness with happy voices, and breaking its wild solitudes
with the enchanting presence of beauty and love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John always received us with a graceful suavity, which
seemed strange in one so unaccustomed to society. We
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>first paid our visit to our father’s grave, and offered our
tribute of tears to the ashes and memory of the beloved.
The prophet would improve the occasion to our spiritual
advantage, by repeating with simple eloquence many appropriate
verses of Scripture. We then returned to the
cavern and conversed with the heavenly-minded recluse,
startling the echoes of his lonely hermitage with incidents
of life and travel and society, and with scraps of history,
biography, poetry and philosophy, brought from the gay
and busy circle in which we moved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prophet bore a quiet share in our animated talk,
and partook sparingly of our ample repast. He was full
of childlike earnestness and credulity, easily excited to
smiles, easily moved to tears. The sphere of his thoughts
and feelings was as different from that of the priests and
scribes, as though he had been an angel descended from
heaven,—full of love and wisdom, without creed, without
doctrine, without forms, without ceremonies,—to mock
with his sublime perfection the puny ritualist who imagined
no religion possible without them all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The young prophet seemed to enjoy these semi-annual
disturbances of his thoughtful solitude. He always accompanied
us on our return as far as the great highway.
He was so fully convinced that he was driven into the
wilderness by the Spirit of God, that we did not strive to
allure him back to the haunts of men. I regarded him
as a gentle and amiable fanatic. Martha pronounced him
to be a young man of great promise, destined no doubt
to be a prophet or leader in the Church. Mary’s criticism
was limited to noting the extraordinary sweetness of his
voice and the softness of his hazel eyes. Once also a tear
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trickled down her cheeks, when we spoke of his lonely
days and nights in his self-inflicted solitude.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was in the third year after Beltrezzor’s return, that, on
approaching the cave of the hermit we saw a poor, emaciated
creature, the skeleton, the shadow, of a man,
seated on the stone at its mouth. It was long before we
could recognize in this pitiable object, my generous deliverer,
the Son of the Desert. On feeling the premonitory
symptoms of a dangerous fever, he had left his band,
which was then prowling about the Jordan, and had
come to the cave of the young hermit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You nursed my wounded friend. Take care also of
me. I am sick in soul and body. You are the only
good man in the world. You alone make me believe in
God.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These were the words with which he threw himself
down upon the pallet of skins. Long weeks of illness
had passed away—and he was restored, standing now on
the border of life like a phantom flitting from the tomb.
His great, sad, earnest eyes seemed to say that he neither
cared to live nor was afraid to die.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We took a deep interest in this forlorn robber, who
seemed to act, think and feel so little like a robber. This
proud, handsome man, without name, without friends, was
an enigma to us. He had sternly declined all reward for
his eminent services to us, and we felt under painful obligations
to him. When we bade him adieu with ardent
wishes for his speedy restoration, Martha, with great
dignity and self-possession, took a ring from her finger
and deliberately placed it upon his.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do not forget us,”</span> said she. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our fates may part us,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but the invisible binds. On this ring is engraven the
name of an angel. I give you my guardian-spirit as your
own. May he lead you into peace.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He bowed his head low upon her hand; and when he
raised it, there were tears in his eyes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I noticed after a while that these visits to the desert had
a singular effect upon Mary. For some time preceding
them, there was an exhilaration of spirits, a flush of expectation,
a vivacity of manner, which added a new lustre
to her charms, a new glow to her beauty. During the
visit, however, she was timid, reticent and abstracted:
and afterward for weeks there was an unusual quietness
of demeanor, as well as a tearfulness of the eye and a
pallor of the cheek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lazarus,”</span> said Martha to me one day, <span class="tei tei-q">“had we not
better bring our father’s remains to Bethany and bury
them with our mother’s? It would spare us these long
trips to the desert.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Keen-sighted, motherly sister! But I—who had not
then met with Helena and knew nothing of love—I
answered:

<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no! these visits to John are the most delightful
events of the year.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the fourth spring of these visits Mary took down a
little flower-pot with a rose in it for John.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I bring you a gem,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“of nature’s light—a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That evening when returning, Mary and John fell behind
the rest of us, and when I turned to look after them,
he was pointing out to her some rare beauty of the clouds
about the setting sun; and her face, turned full upon him,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was all aglow with a radiance not reflected from terrestrial
skies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fall visit was looked forward to with unusual pleasure.
It was a glorious day. Why was it that the desert
seemed more solitary than usual? As we approached the
cavern, the silence was appalling. There were no recent
footprints on the sands. The spiders had spun their webs
across the mouth of the cave. It was utterly deserted.
John had gone. He had taken away his pallet of skins,
his earthen vessels for food and drink, his sandals, his
long staff. The flower-pot lay upon the ground with the
little rose-bush in it, long withered and dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sisters burst into tears; and Martha kissed the little
one most tenderly on the cheek.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spirit of God, which impels men to the great
missions of the world, drives them away from the bloom
of nature and from the gardens of the soul,—away into
the wilderness, where, tempted of devils and sustained by
angels, they gather strength for the doom and glory which
await them!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our father’s remains were brought to Bethany. Mary’s
cheek grew paler. The dew of tenderness trembled always
in her eye. She searched the Scriptures all day
long for the coming Messiah. At night she dreamed—

My uncle summoned me one day into his presence,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You must visit Egypt, Greece and Italy,”</span> said he,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the typical centres of the world, and converse with the

money at Alexandria, Athens and Rome, and with letters
to agreeable and influential people.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This will consume three years of your life; and if you

and shall need but little for the rest of my pilgrimage.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then,”</span> he continued to my surprise and sorrow,
<span class="tei tei-q">“then I shall go back to the great East—nearer to the

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Go back to the East?”</span> I exclaimed with trepidation.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why so? Your old age requires the presence of

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Knowing my uncle’s firmness of resolution, and how

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, well!”</span> said he in a cheerful voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“we have

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This plan of perfecting my education by travel, by
coming in contact with idolatrous people and studying
heathen philosophies, excited the fears of my good
sisters, so contrary was it to the custom of the Jews.
They regarded it, indeed, as almost a crime. My uncle,
however, was grandly cosmopolitan in all his sentiments,
and he had imbued my own mind with his enlightened
charity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus accompanied me as my body-servant. We
had taught the dumb African to read and write after he
was released from the bondage of Magistus and Simon.
He acquired these accomplishments in a moderate degree
with great celerity, so that our anticipations of rapid
mental progress were sadly disappointed by the result.
When he reached the intellectual development of a white
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>child at twelve years, his onward march was arrested.
No study, no assiduity could advance him a step farther.
He was organically a child. His thoughts, his feelings,
his opinions, his manners were all child-like; and so
they remained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such is the general result of my observation and study
of the African species. Susceptible as they are of a
beautiful and indefinite moral culture, the development
of their intellectual faculties is limited by the thick
scull, the small brain, the black skin which they have
inherited as a national curse. May it be different in the
future! I have received nothing but kindness at their
hands, and I feel nothing but kindness for them in my
heart.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We learned from Ethopus, through the medium of
writing, that he had been stolen by a party of marauding
soldiers from his quiet and happy home in Abyssinia,
where his father was a petty prince. He had been sold
to some magicians in Egypt, who made him a slave, a
football, a victim of cruel and unnatural experiments.
He had been fed upon toads and serpents and creeping
things. The blood of various animals had been injected
into his veins. The operation of poisons was studied
upon his body. Degradation and terror were imprinted
upon his soul. He had been deprived of his manhood
and his speech, to bring him into total subjection to his
diabolical tyrants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I told him that I should go first into Egypt, he
trembled; for the memory of Simon and his own early
life troubled his mind. I could scarcely have induced
him to accompany me at all, had it not been for the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beautiful gem which my uncle Beltrezzor had given him.
In its prophylactic powers against magic and magicians
he enjoyed implicit faith. He had hitherto carried it
always in his pocket. He now bound it over his heart,
carefully secured in a leathern bag. He then declared
himself ready for the journey. Less fortunate than he,
I had nothing wherewith to fortify myself against evil
spirits and the dangers of land and sea, but the consolations
of Zoroaster’s religion and scraps of the Platonic
philosophy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had only one misgiving on leaving my sisters in the
care of such an old man as our excellent uncle. The
wicked Magistus was still living in the same house, separated
from us only by a stone wall. He guarded my aunt
in the same cruel seclusion, and no doubt kept himself informed
by her clairvoyant powers of everything going on
in our house as well as in others. He had never made
any advances toward us, and there was no communication
between us. I knew, however, that a fierce desire for revenge
rankled in his heart; and his power was now greater
than ever, since he had become a prominent member of
the Sanhedrim, and his friend Caiaphas had been appointed
high-priest of the temple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I spent about a year in exploring the wonders of Egypt,
and had reached Alexandria for a reluctant departure
from that land of fascinations, when a letter was delivered
at my door by some one who disappeared as soon as he
gave it to the servant. This occasioned me some surprise,
and I opened it immediately. On a little piece
of parchment which fell out as I did so, I found these
words:

<span class="tei tei-q">“A wonderful thing has occurred, my dear brother, since
I last wrote. John, the young hermit of the desert, whom
we have mourned as lost or dead, has appeared on the
banks of the Jordan, baptizing the multitudes and preaching
repentance and the remission of sins. He claims to
be the forerunner of the Messiah, announcing the speedy
approach of the King of kings. Crowds are flocking to
him from all Judea and Galilee, and even from distant
regions. His eloquence is so astonishing that many who
go out of curiosity or sport, are stricken to the heart and
receive his baptism.</span>

heads, blessing us in the name of the Messiah, our minds
were filled with a heavenly ecstasy, and we could scarcely
refrain from shouting aloud for joy.</span>

I was still meditating on this letter when Ethopus
rushed into my chamber with a face full of alarm. I
soon learned from his expressive pantomime that he had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seen Simon Magus in one of the public squares, exhibiting
some magical tricks to a great crowd.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Did he recognize you?”</span> said I, anxiously.

Ethopus seemed delighted at these words, and proceeded
with the greatest alacrity to execute my orders;
not, however, until he had so disguised himself that I
positively did not know him when he appeared before
me. He was then so long absent on my errands that I
became apprehensive for his safety. He suddenly entered
the room with an expression of countenance which puzzled
my practiced wit to decipher. It was the wildest
joy strangely mingled with sadness. He found it impossible
to convey his ideas by pantomime. The scene was
ludicrous as well as pathetic. After several frantic and
fruitless efforts, he seized a burnt coal from the hearth
and scribbled on the white wall in great sprawling characters:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

and making signs for me to follow him, he darted from
the room.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We passed rapidly through the streets, Ethopus looking
suspiciously about him all the while, until we reached a
grand bazaar, where thousands of articles were exposed
for sale. We forced our way through crowds of merchants,
each crying his wares; through buyers and sellers
and idlers of every description, chattering and chaffering
in all the languages of the world. We came presently to
some little rooms or stalls where a great many slaves on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sale were exposed, almost naked. Ethopus pointed triumphantly
to a tall young African of handsome and even
noble features, and falling upon his neck, they wept together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They are brothers,”</span> said the trader. <span class="tei tei-q">“Their meeting
was both amusing and affecting. This dumb fellow
recognized the other first, and fell upon his face, shoulders
and hands with frantic kisses. The younger one,
not comprehending such a useless outburst of affection,
resented it as an intrusion, and would have belabored his
brother soundly, had he not been so heavily ironed.
The older one was in despair, but suddenly bethought
himself of taking off a lot of false hair and beard, and
baring his neck and bosom for inspection. The recognition
was then soon effected, and they laughed and wept
alternately in each other’s arms.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He is a slave?”</span> said I.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—and a most unruly one. He was captured in
the late war with the Abyssinians, and although very
young, they say he was a superb soldier. I can well
believe it. He has already passed through several hands,
and was quickly got rid of by them all, on account of his
fierce and dangerous character.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I studied the young man’s physiognomy carefully, but
could discover no trace of ferocity about the features.
He seemed to be about twenty years of age, and had a
manly and dignified bearing as he stood there manacled
and exposed to the public gaze. I read his secret at
once. He was a brave and high-spirited youth, accustomed
to freedom, war, and perhaps to the exercise of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>power; and he did not submit to his chains as quietly as
his owners desired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The slave-dealer must have divined the admiration with
which I regarded him, for he added with a quiet sneer:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“His braveries are at an end now, for he has been
bought for Drusus Hortensius.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And who is Hortensius?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Have you lived in the desert, that you never heard
of Hortensius? Hortensius is the richest man in the
world at present, and the greatest epicure in Rome. He
imitates Lucullus, at least in pride and luxury. He makes
suppers for his friends, of incalculable magnificence. His
demand for nightingales’ tongues has silenced half the
bird-music in the world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is Hortensius in the city?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the city? No! He lives in Rome, which, he
complains, is altogether too small for him. He has an
agent in Alexandria, who has a standing order to send
him about fifty refractory and incorrigible slaves every
year.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What does he want them for?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Want them for?”</span> laughed the dealer. <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you
must know that Hortensius has the greatest and rarest fish-ponds
in the world. They are miracles of beauty. Hortensius
is fond of fish as well as of nightingales’ tongues.
But common fish do not tempt his august appetite.
Lucullus discovered, in the course of his epicurean studies,
that fish fed upon human flesh have a remarkably fine
flavor; and moreover that these aquatic cannibals have a
special relish for the African species of the genus homo.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wretch!”</span> I muttered.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore,”</span> continued the trader, without noticing
my indignation, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hortensius, imitating Lucullus, has a
negro slave cut into small pieces and thrown into his fish-ponds
every week. His children are taken out by their
nurses to witness this choice method of refining the pleasures
of the table.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anthony, for so they had re-named the brother of
Ethopus, had picked up a good deal of Latin, in which
language the dealer was speaking. He had listened intently
and had caught the horrible meaning of his words.
The disdainful and defiant look of the young soldier,
contemplating the fate which awaited him, was a study
for an artist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How can I save him from this cruel bondage, from
this hideous death?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He was purchased yesterday and will be called for
to-day, as the ship sails this evening.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will you cancel that bargain and sell him to me?”</span>
said I eagerly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—for a grand consideration.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I reflected that I had drawn my last funds from my
uncle’s Egyptian agent. Still, I might possibly borrow
largely from him and wait a remittance. I named what I
considered a liberal price. The trader coldly shook his
head. I added a third more to it, determined to sacrifice
a year’s travel in order to save Anthony from the fish-ponds
of the luxurious Roman. The trader declined
without hesitation. I could make no greater offer without
consultation with my uncle, and that was impossible. My
countenance fell in despair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The brothers had watched our conversation with intense
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>interest; and although they did not comprehend its full
meaning, they saw that I had made a great effort to redeem
Anthony and had failed. The face of Ethopus
was full of grief, that of Anthony of sad resignation.
Ethopus suddenly sprang up smiling, as if some great
idea had illumined his mind. He tore open his robe,
and producing a little bag from his bosom, he took out
the precious stone which my uncle Beltrezzor had given
him. He extended the brilliant gem to the trader with
one hand and pointed to Anthony with the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh do not take that,”</span> I exclaimed. <span class="tei tei-q">“This poor
fellow values that stone more than life itself. Nothing
but the most intense affection could prompt him to such a
sacrifice. He believes that stone has delivered him from
the bondage of a terrible magician, and wears it over his
heart as a protecting genius. Accept my offer instead,
which is of greater money value than his gem.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This speech had a singular effect. The slave-dealer
had no generosity, but boundless superstition. He either
had an intense fear of magic himself, or he was in collusion
with magicians. He immediately acceded to Ethopus’
offer, struck the chains from Anthony’s arms and
feet, and put the price of his slave smilingly into his
pocket.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will replace him with that old fellow there, who
would smoke his pipe as he is now doing if we were
burying him alive. The agent of Hortensius counts heads
and never looks into faces.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anthony comprehended that an exorbitant price had
been paid for his liberty, involving some great sacrifice on
the part of Ethopus and he insisted on resuming his
fet<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ters, until I assured them both that the stone with such
magical properties should be replaced by one similar, as
soon as I could communicate with Beltrezzor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Ethopus was now in a state of feverish anxiety to get
aboard the Athenian vessel. The addition of Anthony to
our company seemed to increase his fears and his sense
of responsibility. I conveyed my baggage and my two
servants to the ship, and put them in charge of the captain,
while I returned into the city to finish my business
and to make a few purchases.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I reached the vessel again, Ethopus had disappeared!
Anthony was in great distress, and the captain
and sailors were highly excited. The story they told was
a curious one. A tall, wild-looking man, fantastically
dressed, came and sat down on the shore near the planks
of the ship. Busily engaged in carrying on the small
freight which crowds in just before a vessel leaves, the
sailors paid no attention to him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This man was heard to make some very curious sounds,
a kind of double whistle, a signal which he repeated at
intervals with increasing vehemence and impatience.
Ethopus then came slowly out of the vessel, reeling and
groping like one blind or drunk. He advanced slowly
toward the stranger and knelt at his feet. The poor fellow
suddenly started up with a great shriek and endeavored
to escape. Several of the sailors rushed forward to
rescue him from the man who had seized him and was
dragging him off. The magician, for such he was, drew
a huge yellow serpent from his robe, and flourished it like
a whip at his assailants. Some of the sailors declared
also that a jet of blue flame darted from his bosom.
Cer<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tain it is that by some magical trick he so terrified them
that they fell back in awe, and he escaped with his victim
through the crowd which was gathering.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poor Anthony, who had never seen a ship before, was
walking about the vessel in childlike wonder while this
terrible abduction was taking place. I was in the deepest
distress. I took Anthony and the baggage back to my
quarters. I remained a fortnight in Alexandria instituting
the most thorough search after our lost friend. It was all
in vain. I sailed at last for Athens with a heavy, heavy
heart, and a new servant, leaving the poor dumb eunuch
in the clutches of Simon Magus.

I lived at Athens a year, studying the philosophy
and poetry of the Greeks. I longed to see my
beautiful sisters and my good old uncle; but I
cannot disguise the fact that I was greatly fascinated with
Grecian life and manners. I frequently wished that I had
been born a Greek and not a Jew, and that I could spend
my days in sight of the marble-crowned Acropolis and the
blue Ægean Sea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I taught Anthony to read and write, hoping that he
would prove to be of superior mental calibre to his
brother. But the result was the same. He surprised me
at first by his brightness and afterward by his stupidity.
He was more impetuous than Ethopus, and braver; but
then his spirit had not been broken and subdued by contact
with the magicians of Egypt, those subterranean devils
who defied the assaults of reason against their pretensions
and the vigilance of government against their crimes.
Ceasing to be a good soldier and incapable of becoming
a philosopher, he proved an invaluable servant.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The letters from my sisters, who wrote alternately,
were full of tenderness and piety. They continued to
give glowing accounts of the power and progress of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>teaching of John the Baptist. Martha quoted all the passages
in the prophets alluding to the forerunner of the
Messiah, and Mary dwelt upon the influence of his doctrines
and baptism upon the hearts and lives of the people.
Mary perceived intuitively that the only valuable thing in
a religion is the life which it induces one to lead. One
day I received a letter from this enthusiastic young girl,
which indicated that some great spiritual ferment was
working in the land of Judea:

<span class="tei tei-q">“Do not think I am dreaming! Some time ago John
baptized a young man, whom he pronounced by heavenly
vision to be the Messiah, or as he styled him, the Lamb

It was rumored that he had retired into the wilderness, to
undergo some terrible combat with the powers of hell,
preparatory to his great mission upon earth. Our hearts

<span class="tei tei-q">“After a while we heard that a great prophet had arisen
in Galilee, who had astonished all men by the wonderful
spirituality of his preaching. He had also exhibited
miraculous power by turning water into wine at a marriage-feast
in Cana. Perhaps this Jesus of Nazareth was

names of Nazareth and Galilee be connected with the
Prince of the house of David?</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Not long afterward a strange incident occurred in
the temple. The miracle-worker of Cana appeared, and
assuming extraordinary authority, as if the temple were
his own house, he drove out all the traders and money-changers
and idlers who have so long desecrated the
holy place by the connivance of the corrupt and wicked
priests. They would no doubt have destroyed him in
their anger; but the people, and indeed the better class
of Pharisees also, applauded the courageous act of the
man, who dared, single-handed, to vindicate the holiness
of the Lord’s house, and to scourge the profaners
out of the sacred precincts.</span>

witnessed the scene himself, and that this Jesus of Nazareth

he saw the Spirit of God descending upon him in the
shape of a dove.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“The good Nicodemus, who inquires into everything
quickly, but into nothing thoroughly, paid Jesus a visit

astonished and puzzled at the new ideas of this spiritual

with my eyes, but with my heart and soul. We had
reached the pool of Bethesda by the sheep-market, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were looking at the crowd of feeble and paralytic people,

beat audibly within me. A divine ardor burned in my

If these strange things had occurred soon after my
father’s death, when the spirit of religious inquiry was
strong, and when I loved to search the Scriptures with
my sisters, I would have been deeply, intensely interested
in them. But the hardest thing in the world is to
make a devotee out of a man who thinks himself a philosopher.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My uncle had not converted me to the doctrines of
Zoroaster, but he had convinced me that Zoroaster,
Moses, and all the great leaders of religious thought
derived their inspiration from the same source. I came
tacitly to believe that no special Messiah was coming to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Jews, any more than to the Persians or Egyptians or
Romans, all of whom needed deliverance from mountains
of sin and wildernesses of error, quite as much as the
Hebrew nation which constituted so small a fraction of
the human race.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreover the influence of travel, and especially my
free and happy life at Athens, had quite denationalized
me. I was no longer a Jew.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had breathed the mystic and magical air of Egypt,
and had peeped into one of the very cradles of the
human race; where I found everything so strange and
so unlike what I had been taught by our childish Hebrew
traditions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had trodden all the glorious and beautiful grounds
hallowed in the immortal history and songs of Greece.
I no longer wondered at the host of gods and goddesses
which were conjured from the misty deeps of antiquity,
to guard a nature so prolific and fair, and a people so
perfect in form and so gifted in spirit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The traditions of Greece, the poetry, the eloquence,
the music, the philosophy, the art, and the divine architecture,
which seemed a combination of them all, had so
impressed and transformed my mind, that I looked back
to my narrow circle of life and thought in Judea, as a
man looks back upon the school-room and play-ground
of his childhood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After these things, it was impossible for me to believe
that the Jews were the favored people of God, and that
the descendants of the patriarchs were to govern the
world. It was as easy to believe that the sun rose in
Jericho and set in Joppa.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Therefore I smiled at my sister’s pious enthusiasm, and
said to myself:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This Jesus of Nazareth is some estimable Jew, full of
philanthropy and zeal, possessed perhaps of extraordinary
healing powers. With these he will so astonish the poor
ignorant Hebrews, that they will call him a prophet of
God, or even invest him with divine honors. In Athens
he would be simply a philosopher or a physician, more
or less profound and brilliant. His pretensions would be
scrutinized by a thinking public, and he would receive
applause in proportion to his merit and capacity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was, I must confess, another reason why I did
not turn my face toward Judea; why the prophecies and
their fulfillment had ceased to interest me; and why even
my charming sisters were occasionally forgotten. While
studying the theologies of the nations and poring over
the ethereal pantheism of Greece, I met that wonderful
divinity who flies ever with his golden shafts between the
earth and the sun, and I became the devotee of a new
religion.

In the school of philosophy where the doctrines
of Socrates and Plato were taught with an eloquence
equal to their own, I met a young Greek
resident of the city by the name of Demetrius. He was
the son of Calisthenes, a very wealthy merchant, who,
contrary to the usual custom, attempted to rival in his
private residence the magnificent art which was bestowed
only on the public works. He was ambitious that his
only son should enjoy more than mercantile honors, and
arrive at greater distinction than that which wealth alone
could bestow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As usual in such cases, his paternal aspirations were
doomed to disappointment. Nine-tenths of the genius
of the world comes from that great middle class which
knows neither riches nor poverty. The possession of
great wealth is generally a hinderance to intellectual or
spiritual advancement. Demetrius was a handsome, amiable
fellow, of mediocre talent, slothful by nature and
indulgence, and more ambitious of social success than
of a front place in the class of philosophy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know not how it happened, but he had attached himself
more strongly to me than I to him. I attained the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>entrée of his father’s house by a lucky accident. While
we were rowing in the harbor one day, our little vessel
was capsized, and it was only by my desperate exertions
in his behalf that Demetrius was saved from drowning.
Gratitude did more for the deliverer than friendship had
done for the fellow-student: it opened the doors of the
princely mansion, and showed me the household gods.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was rejoiced at this, for I had heard one of my
companions say:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Helena, the sister of Demetrius, is the most wonderful
creature in the world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I verified the truth of his remark. It was indeed the
echo of the popular lip. Helena was an institution of
Athens, sought, seen and admired like its other wonders
and beauties. No language can convey any adequate description
of this cunning masterpiece of nature. There
was no statue in all the rich collections of Grecian art,
which excelled the matchless symmetry of her form or
the perfect beauty of her features. She was the poet’s
dream of perfection, embodied in the delicate tissues of a
splendid womanhood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A neck and bust of immaculate beauty were surmounted
by a head, every attitude of which was a study for
artists and lovers. Her hair was a cloud of dark, brown
waves faintly dashed with gold. Her broad imperial
brow was pure as the silver surface of some cloudless
dawn. Her soft, hazel eyes were radiant centres of inexpressible
light and power. Her cheeks, nose, mouth
and chin were miracles of shape, warmth and color.
Her shell-tinted ears were hung with pearls less beautiful
than themselves; and a necklace of golden beads made
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>conspicuous a throat which it could not beautify. Her
hands and fingers were so lucid, delicate and expressive,
that they might be called features also, revealing in part
the movements of her mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poor artist that I am, I throw my pencil down in
disgust. I cannot reproduce Helena to your eyes as she
appeared to me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To see this woman, for a young enthusiastic spirit,
with his celestial dream pressing downward for realization,
was to love her. The shaft of love flies from one
eye to another; from the eye to the heart; from the
heart to the brain; from the brain to the soul. I
looked, I loved. I was smitten to the soul by that
malady which has no cure but the cause which inflicts it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Helena had not only an irresistible sweetness of voice
and grace of manner, but she had a singular directness
of attack, concentrating all her charms upon you at
once; so that few men ever left her presence without
feeling that she had absorbed and taken from them some
portion of their life, which they could only recover by
returning into the enchanted atmosphere which surrounded
her beautiful person.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus bewildered by her beauty and bewitched by her
fascinations, I lost my life when away from her, and
found it again, enhanced and glorified, when I approached
her footstool. I was attracted to her continually;
and if I tore myself away, and climbed the mountain-top,
or walked by the sea-shore, she became the inspiring
genius of my solitary rambles; and the beauties of nature
were only beautiful, because in some inexplicable manner
they seemed akin to, or associated with her.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, day after day, week after week passed by, and
philosophy became as dry as dust, and my companions
silly and unprofitable; and Egypt became a myth and
Judea a dream; while the past was forgotten and the
future uncared for, except in connection with her. Solitude
became sweet, and reverie ecstatic, and the language
of poetry the voice of common life. I created for
myself an ideal world, romantic, ethereal, felicitous; for
the greatest magician that ever lived is Love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was sometimes, however, sunk into the fathomless
abyss of despair. I met in the splendid halls of Calisthenes
so many distinguished and wealthy and powerful
men; so many soldiers and statesmen; so many philosophers,
artists and poets; all many degrees superior to
myself, and all paying the same homage to the idol I
worshiped, that my envy and jealousy were being continually
excited; and I frequently shrank within myself,
taciturn and melancholy, contemplating the awful distance
which intervened between my feeble pretensions
and the transcendent object of my admiration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then Helena, observing my silence and grief, would
single me out from the crowd with a peculiar sweetness;
would bestow a smile which seemed meant only for me;
would drop a sentence of pearl which I felt that I alone
comprehended; would solicit my early return in a manner
so special and impressive, that I was fired with new
hope and endowed with new life; spurned the dull earth
beneath me, and was ready, like the daring boy of
Apollo, to drive the chariot of the sun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let no one ever despair,”</span> I would thus fondly say
to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“of conquering a woman by love.
Concen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trate the passion of your soul upon her, like the rays of a
burning glass, and sooner or later, you will melt her
heart. The best philter to excite love is love itself. If
you would ignite, you must burn.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With all this magnificent exterior, with the blended
adornments of nature and art, this Helena was altogether
unworthy of the pure and simple love I lavished upon
her. She studied men as the angler studies the character,
habits and locality of fish; solely to allure and capture
them. She had the thoughtful brow and the words of
wisdom for one class; the smile of the cupid and the
laugh of the bacchante for another. She had an armory
full of weapons; the tear of sympathy, the corruscations
of wit, the meekness of modesty, the humility of religion,
the splendor of dress, the ornament and even the
exposure of person. Everything about her was the
highest art in a garb of the sweetest nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She hesitated at nothing which would secure her a
conquest. She was unhappy unless many were kneeling
at her shrine. She lived upon the breath of adulation,
the music of her own praises, the incense of delirious
love. She wished to absorb everything; she gave nothing
in return. She demanded for herself affection,
thought, worship, life. She returned only smiles, hopes,
dreams, shadows. She was a beautiful demon of selfishness.
There were fascination, magic, spiritual death in
her sphere; but the soul died listening to invisible
music and dreaming of heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This adoration of men and envy of women was more
to be pitied than admired. She had a mother whose
influence was a dark shadow cast upon her life. Neither
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beautiful nor gifted herself, she had determined that the
gifts and beauty of her child should be turned to the
utmost account. She had planted a wild ambition in
her girlish spirit, as one plants a rose in a garden. She
had nourished it and watered it carefully, until she
brought it to baneful perfection. Her own evil nature
was transfused into the child.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She taught her that power, wealth, fashion, glory,
were the true objects of rational pursuit. She cultivated
her vanity, her petulance, her imperiousness. She basked
in the sunshine of her beauty and power. Fatal
parasite! she drew from the virgin tree upon which she
fastened, the sustenance she could not herself extract
from the earth and air. The too pliant pupil accepted
and improved all the lessons of the teacher; and behold
the result!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the true character of Helena I knew nothing at the
time. That discovery was the result of subsequent information
and experience. Nothing occurred in those
blissful days to break the spell of the enchantress. I did,
indeed, once or twice notice the contrast between this
Athenian goddess and my pure and sweet sisters. I did
once or twice wonder that Sappho and Horace should be
her favorite poets, and Aspasia her model of female character.
But these shadowy doubts, like the faint threat of
clouds which sometimes appear in the clearest heaven,
soon passed away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Helena, petted and spoiled, set all the regulations of
fashion and propriety at defiance. She did as she pleased,
and every one was pleased with what she did. Not every
one; for she was the terror of rigid mothers and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scandal of prudish maidens. She walked unveiled in the
streets. She made herself conspicuous at the theatre and
the racing-grounds. She visited artists in their studios
and poets in their chambers. She received very questionable
visitors at very unseasonable hours. Her dressing-room
even opened its doors to favorite lovers, or to
those of whom she wished to make a convenience. All
this was done so boldly, so gracefully, so naïvely, that no
one dared to express a hint against her virtue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She admitted me to her presence on a very familiar
footing. One evening I called to see her, when she was
dressing for a grand supper, and the servant ushered me
into her boudoir. She was one bright blaze of jewels and
beauty. The dressing-maid was giving the last caressing
touches to her hair. She was scrutinizing the work in
a metallic mirror with an ivory handle, which she held
like a fan.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come! my Judean!”</span> she said, casting upon me one
of her most bewitching glances—<span class="tei tei-q">“come and put this ring
into my ear.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This captivating service I rendered with trembling
hands and palpitating heart. The dressing-maid smiled
at my awkwardness and trepidation. Helena never looked
more resplendent. I felt helplessly bound to the chariot-wheels
of her destiny.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The waiting-girl left the room, and falling at the feet
of the unimpassioned beauty, I stammered forth my
passion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Helena! do you know that I love you?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She was contemplating her chin in the mirror, and
replied without looking at me:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Of course you do. Everybody does.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But, Helena! I cannot live without loving you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That is charming. Love me then and live.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Helena!”</span> said I, sternly, <span class="tei tei-q">“you mock me. You
allure me as if I were a man; and then you treat me as
if I were a boy. You invite me; you evade me; you tantalize
me. Can you not love me?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Let me see,”</span> said she, looking up at the Judgment
of Paris beautifully frescoed on the ceiling; <span class="tei tei-q">“let me see:
I love wisdom, riches, power and glory. When you are
wise as Socrates, rich as Crœsus, eloquent as Cicero, and
powerful as Cæsar, I will love you and give myself to
you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your combination is impossible,”</span> said I, proudly,
biting my lip with failing heart and unconcealed vexation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her face suddenly became radiant with a yielding,
tender and beautiful expression, and I added:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But if it existed, Helena, you would be worthy of
it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“To love such as yours,”</span> she said, sweetly, pressing
my hands, <span class="tei tei-q">“all things are possible. We have been
dreaming in the boudoir; let us converse in the parlor.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She led the way and overwhelmed me with such civilities
that I forgot the past which had wounded me, and
had golden glimpses of that magical future which was to
console and bless me. Such is the dream-land of love!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters continued to write the most glowing letters,
full of piety and tender affection. Their rehearsal of
miracles and parables, and of voices from heaven, their
enthusiasm, their faith, their zeal, all fell as dull and cold
upon my ear as the monotonous songs of an old nurse.

I was awakened from my delicious dream by
Demetrius, who importuned me to accompany
him to Rome, whither he had been despatched
by his father on business of extreme importance. This
reminded me that a visit to Rome was an essential part
of my uncle’s educational programme. I had abandoned
philosophy for love, and love cares nothing for thought,
except as one mode of expressing the sentiments. My
education, therefore, was at a stand-still. I hesitated and
shuddered at the idea of leaving the charmed circle in
which I stood entranced. I would, perhaps, have neither
gratified my friend nor obeyed my uncle, had not Helena
carelessly dropped the remark, that no student could truly
regard his course of instruction completed until he had
visited Rome. To acquire this title to perfection in the
eyes of Helena, I endured the pangs of parting and the
miseries of absence; became a compliant friend and an
obedient nephew. I went to Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rome did not impress me so favorably as Athens. I
was fond of art, but cared little for glory. The efforts of
man to reproduce the beauties of Nature excited my admiration;
his labors to immortalize himself and his deeds
excited my contempt. The art of Rome was imported;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her glory was self-acquired. I had soon seen all that I
cared to see of the imperial city, which Augustus had
found of brick and left of marble.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Demetrius had letters to some of the most powerful and
influential men in Rome, so that we were soon introduced
into the best society there. It was not long before we
received an invitation to one of the splendid suppers of
Hortensius, the richest man and the greatest epicure in
the world. I remembered the conversation of the slave-dealer
at Alexandria. I mentally resolved, as we drove
through the magnificent arch of his palace gate, that,
although I might taste of the nightingales of Hortensius, I
certainly would take none of his fish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Beware of the fish-ponds,”</span> said I, laughingly, to
Anthony, who accompanied us as footman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This palace of Hortensius was an affair of Babylonian
magnificence. Everything about it was of colossal proportions.
It was said to have as many chambers as there
were days in the year. Hortensius had twelve bed-rooms
for himself, each named after one of the months, and gorgeously
furnished in a manner to represent the month
after which it was named. There were seven banqueting-halls
named after gods and goddesses—the dreams rather
than the creations of art. This grand structure was burned
during the fire in the reign of Nero, and its splendors, no
longer to be found anywhere on earth, are already regarded
as fabulous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We supped in the Hall of Apollo.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The company was altogether male, which I did not
regret; for I did not wish to see or speak to a woman in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the world but Helena or my sisters. It was composed of
the magnates, the great stars of Roman society—soldiers,
statesmen, senators, governors, etc.—the least of them
immeasurably above the two young plebeian students,
who, dumbfounded at all they saw, could not but experience
a painful sense of their own insignificance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On my right hand, however, at the table, was a noble
and sedate Roman, Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea.
He had visited Rome to consult the emperor and the
senate about the affairs of his province, and was on the
eve of returning. He seemed pleased when he learned
that my home was in the neighborhood of Jerusalem; and
with great tact and urbanity drew me out of my abstracted
mood, dissipated my bashfulness, and engaged
me in an animated conversation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Hall of Apollo was a miracle of beauty. Its area
was immense; its shape, circular. Supported by twenty-four
golden columns, the ceiling rose to a vast height, as
a blue dome painted to represent the visible heavens.
The sun blazing up through masses of dense and crimson
clouds; the intensely clear cerulean ether above; the horizon
all around pierced by mountain peaks, overhung by
rolling vapors of purple and gold, produced an illusion
of astonishing power and magnificence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every object in the room, the pictures, the statuary,
the bass-reliefs upon the columns, the carvings upon the
couches and the gorgeous table, and even the engravings
and embossings upon the splendid vases and vessels which
adorned it, were all descriptive or symbolical of Apollo,
his attributes and achievements. The wonder of the hall,
however, was a golden chandelier of incredible size,
con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>taining a thousand rose-colored tapers, which lighted the
scene with a brilliancy rivaling the day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will not attempt to describe the feast, having no particular
fondness for epicurism. The bill of fare exceeded
anything I had ever imagined. There was service after
service, dessert after dessert, wine after wine, seemingly
without end. The meat-courses, lasting about three hours,
were presented by handsome boys of every nationality,
clad in beautiful livery. The after-courses, of sweets and
luxuries, were brought on by female servants, lovely in
person and graceful in manner, revealing by their dress or
otherwise every charm of the human body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the company was well filled and duly flushed by
the delicious wines, the whole western wall of the apartment,
by some hidden and admirable mechanism, suddenly
opened or changed like a dissolving view, and revealed
an interior apartment a little above the level of
ours, which looked like a beautiful garden adorned and
lighted in a style of Oriental magnificence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The shrubbery and flowers of this garden were the concentrated
beauties of the floral world in all regions, cultivated
here by art, and offering an incense of perfume to
these Roman rulers, who aspired to conquer not only
man but nature. Ivory statues of gods and goddesses,
of nymphs and fawns and satyrs, added greatly to the
beauty of the scene. But when a dozen dancing-girls
alighted as it were from heaven upon this miraculous
stage, and whirled among these statues and flowers, less
perfect and beautiful than themselves, the fascination, to
those who regarded such enchantments, was complete.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“More music! more wine!”</span> cried Hortensius from
his purple couch a little elevated above the rest—<span class="tei tei-q">“the
feast of thought ends always in the feast of love.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The banquet progressed with continued variations of
stimulus and entertainment. The guests were regaled by
invisible music, repeatedly changed, and representing the
airs and styles of every nation which had bowed its head
to the Roman conqueror. The wine fell fast into golden
goblets from vases composed of precious gems. The day
dawned. The noise and excitement increased: the conversation
degenerated into a babble, and the feast into a
debauch; when a most extraordinary incident occurred,
changing my uncle’s programme and perhaps my whole
fate in the twinkling of an eye.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A great clamor was heard outside of the door nearest
Hortensius. Loud and angry voices, the rapid tread of
many feet, curses, groans, shrieks, indicated the approach
of some dreadful storm. It was a thunderbolt in a clear
sky. All sprang to their feet and advanced toward the
sounds, when the door was burst open with violence, and
my servant Anthony rushed in, foaming at the mouth,
bleeding profusely from several wounds and flourishing
an immense knife over his head.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will kill him if I die for it!”</span> he shouted, glaring
fiercely on the brilliant crowd before him, and endeavoring
to single out the object of his hate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What does all this mean, Anthony?”</span> I exclaimed,
leaping forward and seizing him by the throat.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have saved him from the fish-pond,”</span> he answered
sternly, pointing to the naked form of a poor negro,
whom the domestics had at last succeeded in hurling to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the floor, and who had followed Anthony, defending him
from his pursuers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And why did you not fly? madman!”</span> I exclaimed,
<span class="tei tei-q">“why did you come here?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! death was inevitable,”</span> he answered, in a tone
of desperation, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I determined first to kill the vile
despot, the author of these cruelties.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Slave! barbarian!”</span> echoed from all parts of the hall.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Slave I am: barbarian I may be!”</span> shouted Anthony
defiantly; <span class="tei tei-q">“but in my country they do not feed fishes
with men.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The crowd had stood back a little while we were
speaking: but now there was a sudden rush upon us in
front and rear. I was pushed forcibly aside, and Anthony
was borne down, disarmed and bound with his fellow-prisoner,
whose rescue had caused this great excitement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Throw the old one to the fishes immediately,”</span> cried
Hortensius in a loud and cruel tone. <span class="tei tei-q">“Bind this young
villain by the pond and guard him till I come. I will
cut him up, strip by strip, with my own hands.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A murmur of approbation ran through the assembly.
Thrusting the bystanders away, I confronted Hortensius
face to face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“O most noble Roman,”</span> I exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“pardon
something in this poor man to the spirit of liberty. He
was born free, a prince in his little realm; and like you,
he has been a brave soldier. Misfortune in war, not
crime, has enslaved him. He is honest, faithful and
noble. It was a fierce and glorious love of his own race
which has fired him to this rash deed. His sublime
self-sacrifice, his desperate courage surely deserve a better
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fate at the hands of a Roman and a soldier. Spare him
and forgive him!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be difficult to describe the fierce and haughty
stare which Hortensius and his noble guests fixed upon
me during this little speech. They wondered at my folly,
my stupidity, my audacity. To plead for a black slave
who had drawn his knife against a Roman senator! To
accord the spirit of liberty to such vermin of the earth!
To speak of them as brave, faithful, noble, glorious, sublime!
They were stupefied at the novelty and heresy of
such ideas. I was certainly either a fool or a madman.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hortensius, lowering his voice and infusing into it a
little suavity,—for he suddenly remembered that I was
his guest,—exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The proper discipline of my palace, young man,
demands the immediate death of this would-be assassin.
I will replace your servant with a better.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That is beyond your power,”</span> I replied impetuously;
<span class="tei tei-q">“your whole household would not replace him. I am
indebted to his brother for my sister’s life and honor.
I am bound to this man’s flesh and blood as if they
were my own. I cannot, I will not desert him in his
extremity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were loud exclamations of surprise, contempt
and disapproval. Many, however, were silent, touched
perhaps by a latent magnanimity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What will you do?”</span> exclaimed a haughty old Roman
in a most provoking tone.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do?”</span> said I rashly, striking my hand upon the hilt
of my dagger, <span class="tei tei-q">“do?—I will defend him: I will die
with him.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This caused a great uproar in the assembly. Loud
cries of
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Away with him! out with him!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Insult a Roman senator!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Abettor of slaves and assassins!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Insurrectionist! Madman! Idiot!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Down with the base Judean!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
resounded through the splendid Hall of Apollo. My
friend <a name="corr156" id="corr156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Demetrius</span>, who had hitherto stood near me, now
slipped into the crowd and disappeared. Having defied
the supreme power of the place, I would probably have
shared the fate of the wretched Ethiopian, had not assistance
come to me from an unexpected quarter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pontius Pilate stepped between Hortensius and myself,
and waving his hand with great dignity and grace,
requested silence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pardon, dear friends and most noble senators!
pardon the wine which has made this rash youth forget
both reason and duty. He is a subject of mine, being a
native and resident of my province. I claim jurisdiction
over him, and will punish him as he deserves. He is
from this moment a prisoner in charge of my retinue.
He shall be carried back to his native village, disarmed,
bound and disgraced, so that all Judean youths may
know what folly it is to insult a Roman senator.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a strong murmur of approbation throughout
the assembly, and Hortensius nodded approval.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pilate continued:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I would not say a word to save this African from the
death he so richly merits, were it not for one dark suspicion
which crosses my mind and which will not permit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>me to be silent. I suspect this infuriate wretch to be a
madman; and the insane, you know, are under the protection
of the gods and, sacred from the fangs of the law.
Permit me to convey this slave also in irons to Judea. I
will have his case carefully studied by my own physician.
If the gods have smitten him in their wisdom, let him go
free as our laws direct. If he exhibits enough reason to
be held responsible, I will have him driven into the
dreadful desert beyond the Salt Sea, and sentence him to
a perpetual exile in its awful solitudes. If he is ever discovered
west of the river Jordan, his punishment shall be
death, without question or delay.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether this proposition struck the hearers as remarkable,
or what was more likely, the social and civil weight
of Pontius Pilate bore down their opposition and silenced
their scruples, Hortensius acceded to it and all seemed
satisfied. After drinking again to the health of Hortensius,
the company dispersed. I soon found myself a
prisoner bound for Judea, deserted by Demetrius, exiled
from Helena, full of sadness and dark forebodings, with
the educational tour projected by my good uncle brought
to a sudden and ignominious conclusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only comfort I experienced during the long and
melancholy voyage was the thought that I had saved the
life of my high-spirited Anthony, whom I was not permitted
to see, and whose daring conduct I more admired
the more I thought of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was struck also with the wonderful tact, courtesy
and kindness of Pontius Pilate. I would gladly have
thanked him for his services; but I was kept in strict
confinement, and heard and saw nothing of the sedate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>governor. On our arrival at Jerusalem, I was unbound
and taken privately before him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You are now free,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“I admire you too
much to inflict any further punishment upon you for
your incredible rashness. You cannot help being brave,
but you can compel yourself to be prudent. Go, sir!
When you get into trouble again, let me hear from you
and I will befriend you, if possible.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And my servant?”</span> said I, hoping to intercede for
Anthony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He has been driven into the desert.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An hour afterward I was trudging up the Mount of
Olives, thinking of what a joyous surprise I was about to
give to some dear little souls in Bethany.

How beautiful was my old home, embowered in
trees and perfumed with flowers! How charming
were my lovely sisters, twin-stars of the social
heaven, dropping sweet influence on all who received
their tender light! How peaceful and pure was the self-sacrificing
old age of Beltrezzor, over whose pagan heart,
so full of simple love and wisdom, the most orthodox
angels kept kindly watch!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A great sadness rested upon our little household, on
account of the recent murder of John the Baptist by the
cruel Herod, at the instigation of a still more cruel woman.
That pure and good man had been cast into
prison about the time that Christ began his ministry, and
the morning star paled on the approach of the blazing
Sun. He had ever been remembered with peculiar tenderness
and gratitude; and heaven became dearer to
us by receiving into its fold the gentle hermit of the
wilderness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters had grown lovelier. On Martha’s clear brow
the sweet maturity of thought was imprinted. Mingled
with the light of love on Mary’s face was a touching
sadness, of which none but Martha and I suspected the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>meaning. These women, so pure, so cultivated, so beautiful,
were abstracted from the entire world. Sought by
many lovers, they had discarded the very thought of love.
They were wedded in heart to the heavenly bridegroom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They had heard but once from our old friend, the Son
of the Desert. A strange servant, no doubt a disguised
robber, brought back the ring with a note from the
wanderer, saying that he was unworthy to wear it; that
it afflicted him with sorrowful dreams and burned into
his soul like iron. Martha herself fortunately met him
at the gate, and would not permit him to depart without
an answer, as he was instructed to do. She sent back
the ring with her love and Mary’s to the savior of their
brother, with the solemn assurance that the ring had a
great blessing for him concealed within its curse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I soon discovered that my sisters had but one idea, one
study, one passion. Their individuality was lost in their
perpetual concentration of soul upon one object. That
object was Jesus Christ. They no longer spoke of him
as the prophet of Nazareth. Martha had at last discovered
with her eyes what Mary had seen with her
heart. He was the Son of God: He was the Messiah.
With subdued voices and reverent gestures they called
him the Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this was very strange to me, fresh from beautiful
and romantic Greece, where altars were erected to a
thousand gods: fresh from the schools of philosophy,
where the only deity taught was a spiritual essence, infinite,
inconceivable, unfathomable. I listened, however,
with interest to the recital of miracles which were certainly
astounding; to parables which were replete with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spiritual wisdom; and to discourses—for my sisters treasured
all his words by heart and repeated them to me—which
were radiant with a certain divine light and beauty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was ready to concede that this man must be the
greatest philosopher of the age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was the opinion of our good uncle, who, however,
took no trouble to see or hear the worker of such great
miracles. He said there was nothing new under the sun;
that all things repeated themselves over and over again;
that all wisdom had been spoken and every miracle performed
ages and ages ago. The Son of God was in his
mind synonymous with a disciple of the Sun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor was sorry that I did not remain a year at
Rome, for he said the practical atmosphere of that city
would have moderated and utilized the ideality I had
drawn from Athens. He was greatly pleased, however,
with my conduct at the supper of Hortensius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The man who sees any reason,”</span> he would say, <span class="tei tei-q">“why
Hortensius should be more wealthy, more powerful, more
respected, more glorious than Anthony, has not incorporated
into his soul the first ray of the divine principle of
fire, and is altogether ignorant of the power and beauty
of the sun.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few weeks after my return, Beltrezzor transferred the
whole of my father’s estate, improved and augmented,
into my hands. No reasonings, no entreaties could induce
him to abandon or even to defer his long-contemplated
journey to the extreme East. A strange, sad home-sickness
had apparently seized him; and he waited with a
childish impatience for the arrival of the caravan from
Egypt which was to escort him to Assyria.

It came at length; and our adieus were long and bitter.
We were bound to him not only by a pious gratitude for
his rich gifts and his unvarying kindness, but by a genuine
love of his sweet, sincere and noble nature. We wept at
the thought of the dear old man going away into that far-off,
marvelous Orient, without a wife or child to comfort
his declining years. My sisters also seemed overwhelmed
with grief, that one so good and so beloved had rejected
to the last, with a quiet, polite incredulity, all the evidences
of the divine mission of Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man’s parting words to me, as he leaned from
his camel, whispering in my ear, were these:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Beware, my son, of the spirit of fanaticism which
has fallen upon your good sisters. I bequeath you this
verse from one of the sacred books in Persia. It is my
last and best gift to you. Do not forget it:—</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is more truly pious to sow the ground with diligence,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few days after my uncle’s departure, we were invited
to dine at the house of a worthy Pharisee, Simon
by name, who was touched at heart with a secret admiration
of Jesus. Preoccupied as I was with thoughts of
Helena, and caring nothing about spiritual things, I
would not have accompanied my sisters but at their
earnest solicitation. They had been assured that Jesus
would be present, and they were anxious for me to
behold the object of their love and worship.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He came, and saluted us all with a charming grace
and sweetness of manner. His face was handsome,
thoughtful and benevolent, but did not strike you as
ma<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>jestic or sublime. There was a winning sociality in his
conversation, which you did not expect from his serene
and rather pensive countenance. He was quiet and
modest in his demeanor; and instead of leading the
thoughts of the company, he spoke less than any one
present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reflecting, by the light of later and grander experiences,
upon the first impressions made on me by this
mysterious man, I am convinced that not only his face,
his expressions, his words, but his whole life was comparatively
a sealed book to the people who saw him in
the flesh. They saw only the outside, the husk, the
fleshly, not the heavenly part of him. They were ignorant
of the sublimities, the infinities concealed within.
Whoever sees only the physical and not at the same
time the spiritual side of anything, sees little. The
flowers, the gems, the clouds, all beautiful objects, on
the spiritual side are full of sacred mysteries. Ignorant
of these little things, how could the men of that day
comprehend the Christ?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What a different banquet from that of Hortensius! A
plain room, opening directly on the street; a plain
table; a plain company. At Rome we had a wild ambition,
aspiring to universal empire, and imitating even in
its luxuries all the splendors of heaven and earth. Here
were simple tastes, frugal habits, civic industry, neighborly
love. There the presiding genius was the demon
of pride; here it was the Divine Man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The feast was nearly over, when a woman, closely
concealing her face in a black veil, glided softly into
the room and stood behind Jesus. This would not have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attracted special attention, for people were coming in
and going out all the time; but I remembered Mary’s
account of the mysterious woman who always followed
Jesus and his disciples at a distance. I therefore watched
the movements of this person with considerable
interest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She bent low over the feet of Jesus as he reclined on
his couch, and I observed that she was weeping. She
seemed deeply agitated. Suddenly she let down the
great mass of dark brown hair from her head, and began
wiping the feet of the Lord. Washing his feet with her
tears and wiping them with the hair of her head! What
touching humility! What contrition!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then she anointed his feet with a precious ointment
which she drew from her bosom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My thoughts were concentrated on that kneeling
figure. I entered so deeply into what I imagined to be
her feelings and sorrows, I was so attracted by what must
have been a secret spiritual affinity with her own soul,
that I heard almost nothing of the conversation which
ensued between Jesus and Simon, and which is recorded
by the apostle Luke who was himself present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the divine voice pronounced the verdict, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy
sins are forgiven;”</span> a strange and bewildering sense of
delight came over me, as if I myself had been the sinner
who sought and found the pardon of sin. I was
contemplating in amazement this reverberation, as it
were, of the woman’s sentiments in my own spirit, when
Jesus said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy faith hath saved thee: go in peace;”</span>
and the woman turned slowly around and walked sobbing
out of the door.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Scarcely knowing what I did, I quietly withdrew from
my place at the table and followed her. Suddenly, in
some ecstasy of religious feeling, she threw her arms
wildly toward the sky, the veil was lifted for a moment,
and I recognized the beautiful, sorrowing and purified
features of Mary Magdalen!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The spell which overpowered me was instantly withdrawn,
and I returned to my seat. No psychology I had
ever been taught, threw any light on this singular phenomenon;
and it remained a mystery until solved by that
special light of the spiritual world which I alone of all
men have enjoyed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After that the mysterious preacher and miracle-worker
was a frequent visitor at our house in Bethany. I came
no nearer to him than at first: I understood him no
better. He was a good, wise, wonderful man; beyond
that I could not penetrate. I became intimate with all
his disciples; and I loved to dispute with them on theological
subjects, and to puzzle their uncultivated brains
with my philosophical doubts and quibbles. But in the
presence of their master I had nothing to say. I stood
abashed and silenced by some secret power which I could
not explain. I never thought, however, of acknowledging
him as the Messiah, or the Son of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reason was, that my heart and mind were too
closely riveted to nature and the things of sense, to rise
to the conception and love of spiritual things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the faces of my sisters were growing more and
more radiant and serene from the spiritual life which was
deepening in their souls, mine became pale and haggard
from the burden of concealed longings and the vigils of a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>burning but unfed hope. I had written and rewritten to
Helena, but received no answer. I would have returned
to Athens; but the fear of leaving my tender and helpless
sisters so near to such a subtle enemy as Magistus, and
Beltrezzor away off in Persia, detained me unwillingly at
Bethany.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Absence extinguishes a feeble love; but intensifies a
great one. I brooded in solitude. I took interest in
nothing. Conversation was irksome. Religion and philosophy
were alike neglected. I experienced that apathy
which a great desolation of heart produces, and which
men attribute to moroseness or stupidity. I was feeding
with the intense hunger of love upon my treasured memories
of Helena; devouring every word she had spoken,
every look, every tone, every changing form, every shifting
light of her miraculous beauty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My love for Helena, for reasons which I did not then
comprehend, was not of a soothing, ennobling, purifying
type. It was a disquieting, paralyzing, corroding passion.
The sphere of this woman, wholly incapable of the heavenly
duties of wife and mother, did not lead me, encouraged
and strengthened, into the sweet and useful activities
of life. Like an evil spirit rather, it drove me into the
wilderness; tempted me with stones which were not
bread; and haunted me with wild dreams and insane
ambitions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus many weeks passed away, and the fever of my
soul had so worn and wasted me that my sisters became
seriously alarmed at my condition, not knowing the cause;
for I had never divulged my pagan goddess to these pious
little ones.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One day I was suddenly lifted out of the cavern of despair
into the serenest sunlight of hope. I received a
message from Helena that she was traveling with her
father to the most noted places in Asia, and would spend
a few days in Jerusalem; that she was the guest of Alastor,
a wealthy Greek merchant of the city, and that her
visit would be devoid of genuine pleasure unless she could
see once more her esteemed friend, who had saved the
life of her brother.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now occurred a most curious mental phenomenon.
The sudden reaction of joy in the feeble and excited
state of my nervous system, overpowered my brain. I
became the victim of an absurd, grotesque illusion. I
leaped at once from the abyss of self-abasement to the
maddest height of presumption. I transferred my entire
experiences of heart and mind to Helena. She, I imagined,
was pining with unconquerable passion for me.
She was wasted and worn by unrevealed, unrequited
love. She had suffered and faded in silence until longer
concealment was death. Her father had brought her
under cover of travel really to meet me again, to draw
me once more to her feet, to obtain my confessions, and
to receive new hope and life from my words. I was
filled with an unspeakable tenderness, with a generous
compassion. I would fly to her; I would console her; I
would make her life and happiness secure by giving her
my own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Busied with these mad fancies, and muttering them to
myself as I went along, I hurried to the house of Alastor.
Ushered into the presence of Helena, I was surprised and
abashed by the serene and smiling expression of her
coun<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tenance, and her splendid physique, upon which neither
time nor love had yet written the faintest trace of ravage.
She received me without the least embarrassment in the
gay and sparkling manner of a cold and polished queen
of society. I saw in a moment that I was not loved, that
she had never thought of me, that my hopes were dreams,
my passion a madness. I read my doom in the charming
suavity of my reception.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Disappointed, chilled, bewildered, heartsick, miserable,
I maintained a broken conversation for a little while,
until Helena, perceiving with her woman’s wit, something,
and perhaps all of my secret, broke off the interview.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You are sick,”</span> said she tenderly, <span class="tei tei-q">“you are feverish,
you are in pain. You should not have come until to-morrow.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Go home now,”</span> she continued, taking my hand
kindly in hers, <span class="tei tei-q">“go home and be cared for. When you
get better you must come again, and we will talk of
Athens and art, of poetry and love; and of all the
beautiful things that ravish the hearts of men and
women.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not remember what I said, or how I parted from
her. On the portico I met a man going in, whose presence
sent a strange shudder through my frame. My
diseased nerves were very sensitive. He was a person
of handsome face, imposing appearance and gracious
address. He began speaking to me, but suddenly stopped
and fixed his great, black, lustrous eyes fiercely on me.
My first impulse was to resent this conduct as an insult;
but I quickly perceived that my mind was becoming
con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fused, bewildered, fascinated by his gaze, and I averted
my face with a great effort and hurried down the steps.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I did not dare to look back. At the foot of the stairs
I ran heedlessly against our old relative and enemy,
Magistus, whom I had not seen since my return from
Rome. Seizing him by the shoulders I gasped,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who is this man on the portico?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Simon Magus,”</span> said he, with a coarse laugh,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Simon
Magus, the prince of Egyptian magic, and he has evidently
cast the evil eye upon you. Woe to you!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I fled precipitately through the streets. When I reached
home I was in a burning fever. At night I was in a
raging delirium. It was a brain fever of malignant type.
My mad and grotesque illusion about Helena was really
the beginning of my illness. Days and nights of alternate
excitement and stupor passed away; days and nights
of physical torture and mental suffering. My sweet sisters
watched and wept and prayed by my side.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Horrible fantasies besieged my fevered imagination.
I thought that Mary was under the magician’s knife, and
that he would accept no substitute for her bleeding heart
but that of Helena. I opened my eyes and started with
horror; for Mary was seated by my side, with the heart,
as I supposed, torn out of her bosom. Then again, Hortensius
was cutting up the beautiful body of Helena for
his fish-ponds, while the Egyptian held me fascinated by
his terrible eye, so that I could not stir for her help.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I grew worse and the end approached. I had not
realized my condition: I had neither fear nor hope: I
had no thought of death or of Jesus. At last, however,
when I was dying, I heard my sisters calling frantically
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on his name. The name must have touched some silver
chord of memory. The sweet, benevolent face appeared
before me, Mary Magdalen in her dark robe kneeling
behind. The tender words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy sins are forgiven,”</span>
echoed in my ears. Mary and Martha seemed to me
like two shining angels floating up into heaven. A sudden
halo blazed around the head of Jesus. I reached out my
arms to him with wonder and delight, fell back and
expired with a smile upon my lips.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yes! I was dead: and, wonder of wonders! I live
again, to describe my sensations, and to inform my
fellow-men what I saw and heard behind the veil which
separates the two worlds—that veil which is so thin and
yet seems so impenetrable.

Our sleep is an awakening: our death is a birth;
our burial a resurrection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The slumber of a babe upon its mother’s
breast, drawing from her bodily warmth the secret magnetism
of life, is a picture of the true state of every
human soul, leaning unconsciously upon the bosom of
God at the moment when bereaved friends are exclaiming,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He is dead! he is dead!”</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They called me dead. My sisters and their companions
rent their garments and covered their heads with
ashes. Unconscious of their grief, I passed beyond the
shadows of this world, beyond these voices and sorrows,
into the pure light of a spiritual realm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dead, indeed! I lived most when I seemed to live
least. Death is nothing but a name for a change of
condition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first thing I remember on returning to consciousness,
was a soft strain of distant and ravishing music. I
could not open my eyes, nor did I care to do so. It was
perfect bliss to lie there in sweet repose, and listen to
those heavenly sounds which came nearer and nearer.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>I have been asked if there was music in heaven. Why,
the least motion of the air there is musical. Music is to
the ear what light is to the eye; and the sounds of heaven
are as sweet as its colors are beautiful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I next became aware of presences about me. How
can I describe the new sense which informed me of their
nearness! I did not see or feel or hear them. I perceived
them, intuitively as it were, by a holy atmosphere
of love and purity and beauty which came with them.
So the flowers, without senses like our own, when the
dark and chilly night is over, must feel the tremulous
waves of light gladdening around them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These invisible, inaudible attendants were engaged in
some office of love about me. What it was I did not
understand; but I felt as if my body was being drawn
out of something, as a hand is withdrawn from a glove,—although
no one seemed to touch me. I entered into a
state of exalted and blissful sensations, totally new to me,
and quite incomprehensible to men still lingering in the
flesh. My affections seemed to be concentrated or detained
upon pure, tender, lovely and holy things, so
that nothing painful or doubtful or sorrowful should
stain the shining mirror of the soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not know how long this exquisite state of happiness
lasted. It must have been rounded off with a
delicious sleep; for it seemed itself like a sweet and
mysterious dream, when I discovered that I was wider
awake than before, and surrounded by a different though
still delightful and purifying sphere of <a name="corr172" id="corr172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">impressions</span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the presences about me I seemed to absorb
the power of thinking and remembering distinctly. I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>could not open my eyes, but I seemed to be contemplating
a luminous atmosphere, an infinite variety of
splendid and dazzling colors, a whole universe of light.
The ecstasy of Joy with which, bewildered and fascinated,
I studied this inexpressible chaos of light, is
beyond my power of description. In the midst of it I
felt that two persons were near me, one at my head and
one at my feet. One of them seemed to bend over me,
and to be reading my face as one reads a book. He
then said to the other in a gentle voice:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is good. His last thoughts were about the Lord.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I pondered these words and asked myself whether I
was dead or dreaming or in a trance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My invisible friend then passed his hands several
times gently over my face. He next drew a fine film
from my eyelids and breathed upon my forehead. I
instantly recovered my sight and looked around me.
There were two men before me with beautiful and noble
faces, and clad in robes of shining linen. I could not
remove my eyes from them, there was something so inexpressibly
tender and brotherly in their looks and motions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You are in the world of spirits, my brother,”</span> said
one of them with ineffable sweetness. <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not afraid,
but rejoice! The world of spirits is the vast realm betwixt
earth and heaven into which all men come when
they are first raised from the dead.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Raised from the dead?”</span> said I, in extreme bewilderment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—you have been raised from the dead. You
have left the earth upon which you were born; you have
left your natural body, which your friends will bury in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the ground; you are now in a spiritual body and a spiritual
state of existence.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I looked at myself and looked around me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot understand it,”</span> said I, sorely puzzled.
<span class="tei tei-q">“You are certainly strangers to me, and you look so
unlike any of the men I have ever seen, that I can
readily believe you are angels. Nor do I see my beloved
sisters, Martha and Mary, who, I know, would
not leave my bedside for a moment. But this body is
the same body I have always had; this is the room in
which I have been sick so long; and looking out of that
window, I see the Mount of Olives and the familiar sky
of Judea. Explain how this can be.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They looked at each other smiling, and one of them
replied:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The last impressions made upon the mind linger a
while after death; so that the transition from natural to
spiritual life may not be too sudden, and the sensation
of personal identity may be fully preserved. This will
change to you presently. We do not see the room that
you see, nor the Mount of Olives, nor the Judean sky.
These will all vanish from your sight after a little, and
you will find yourself differently clad and moving about
among novel and beautiful scenes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span>—said I, incredulously,—<span class="tei tei-q">“but this body of
flesh and blood, in which I live, move and think, how
came it here?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That body of flesh and blood you have left behind
you. The soul is a spiritual substance organized in the
shape of its natural body. The natural body resembles
the spiritual as a glove resembles the hand contained
with<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in it. You have dropped the glove. You see the naked
hand.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Our mission,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“is now ended, and
another takes our place. We assist in the resurrection.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They made a motion of departure, but I seized one of
them by the hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh stay!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“do not go. Your words interest
me beyond measure. I would learn more of
the heavenly life. Pardon my incredulity, pity my
ignorance.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One approaches,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“who is much nearer
and dearer to you than we. Relatives delight to render
to relatives these charming offices of comfort and instruction.
He comes!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Who?”</span> I exclaimed, eagerly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your father!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I looked in the direction indicated by the angel’s face.
Out of the darkness—which appeared to me and not to the
angels, for it proceeded from my own mind and not from
theirs—out of the darkness slowly loomed up a human
figure. It brightened as it advanced. Then there stood
before me a young man of radiant beauty, clad in a tissue
of shining purple. His face was full of eager expectation,
sparkling with love and joy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While I was gazing at this form, which seemed to
me a beautiful apparition, the other angels disappeared.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My son! my son!”</span> exclaimed the shining visitor
in a voice of touching sweetness, and which seemed
in some way remotely familiar. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not know
me?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was silent and troubled, for there was not the faintest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>resemblance between the splendid being who stood before
me and the poor father I had buried in the wilderness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am permitted for your sake,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“to return
back into the mental states of my earth-life and to resume
its forms. This is one of the wonders of the spiritual
world, but one which you will frequently see and soon
understand. Look steadfastly at the changes I shall
undergo, and you will believe.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The light about him began to fade. The purple tissue
darkened; his face grew pale; the lustre passed from his
hair. His features gradually changed, becoming less and
less beautiful, less and less youthful. Wrinkles appeared;
his cheeks became haggard; his eyes sunken and sad; his
head bowed and bare; his beard gray. Unsightly scars
came upon his forehead; and when he held up his withered
hands, from which two or three fingers had dropped,
I knew the poor old leper whom the cruel law had driven
into the wilderness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My father! my father!”</span> I exclaimed, weeping at the
sight which recalled so vividly the sorrows long buried in
the soul, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am satisfied. Return again into the <a name="corr176" id="corr176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">beauty</span>

His figure then underwent exactly the reverse series of
changes; and when his angelic form was restored, I fell
upon his neck and wept tears of joy.

I inquired into the philosophy of the astounding metamorphoses
I had witnessed. I was taught that spiritual
things—states of our affections and thoughts—are not so
perishable as natural things; that they are stored away
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and preserved; and that they can be recalled and reproduced
with a fac-simile of all the surrounding concomitants
and phenomena. A spirit can be made to return
into any state of his past life, when he will repeat his conduct
to the least word and motion and incident. Thus
nothing can be concealed; the entire past can be re-enacted;
truth discovered and judgment given.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was in accordance with this great spiritual law of
changing forms corresponding with the changing states
of the soul, that the disciples beheld Jesus from such
different stand-points. If Thomas Didymus could have
entered into the spiritual state of the three disciples on
the mount, he would not have seen the Christ showing the
wound in his side and the print of the nails, but he would
have beheld him radiant—in his transfigured glory. It
was the varying stand-points or mental states of the disciples,
which give us such different manifestations of the
Unchangeable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was not, however, thinking of these things at that
moment. I was contemplating the youth and beauty of
my father’s spiritual body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I was told,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the spiritual body was a
fac-simile of the natural body. How comes it that yours
is so totally different?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When I first rose from the dead,”</span> he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
seemed to myself to be in the same leprous body that I
had in the wilderness; and like all men I found some
difficulty in realizing the fact that I was living in a different
world. The spiritual body or external form of the
soul, changes rapidly according to the changes of its internal
form, which is composed of affections and thoughts.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>In proportion as these are purified from the evil and false

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And why do you look so young?”</span> I inquired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Time,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“does not belong to the spiritual
world. We have no computations here by months and
years; no revolution of suns and planets, which produce
day and night and the changing seasons of the world.
Our external surroundings, what you would call our visible
nature, are the immediate outgrowth of our own spiritual
states. The exterior changes continually with the
interior. All in heaven are therefore young and beautiful,
because their soul-life is good and pure, and is fitly
represented by youth and beauty.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My father then questioned me about the dear ones I
had left behind. He manifested the deepest and tenderest
sympathy in all that had happened to us since his
departure from the world. He had heard of us frequently
from new-comers into the world of spirits. We do not
cease to love our earthly friends after death. But in the
heavenly life there is such a thorough, soul-satisfying trust
in the wise and merciful guidance of Divine Providence,
that fears, doubts and anxieties about our absent loved
ones, are utterly impossible.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And my mother?”</span> I inquired in turn,—<span class="tei tei-q">“my mother

The angel who assisted in my resurrection was right.
The objects which surrounded me at my death, and
which lingered a while on my mental vision, had faded
away. I found myself in a strange but beautiful world,
the forms of which were similar to ours, but the laws
which governed their appearance and disappearance very
different.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I must confess that I was supremely astonished to find
myself living, feeling, thinking, precisely as I did before
my death. My mind indeed seemed more active, more
penetrating than ever. My body had a buoyancy, a
strength, a healthfulness pervading it, which were accompanied
by a sense of intense pleasure. But it still seemed
the same body in which I had previously lived; and I
could scarcely comprehend my father when he told me
that my sisters and friends were making preparations to
bury my earthly form.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh that I could look down upon them,”</span> said I,
<span class="tei tei-q">“could speak to them, could show them my true self,
and lift their souls out of the fearful shadow of the tomb!
Why is it not granted us to cheer the hearts and illumine
the minds of those who are sorrowing so vainly over our
cold dust?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They would not believe you, my son, if it were permitted.
They would call your manifestation to them a
vision, a hallucination, a dream. They are in such bondage
to sensuous appearances, and to reasonings based upon
them, that nothing but death will break their chains. It
will take generations, ages, centuries, cycles of natural
time to render higher thought on that subject possible.
New civilizations, new churches, new revelations must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>arise before mankind can be delivered from this terrible
darkness.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And that natural body,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“laid in the grave,
and food for worms, is not to rise again?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why should it?”</span> said my father. <span class="tei tei-q">“Who wants it?
What use could it subserve? Are we not in spiritual
bodies clothed with all beauty and perfection? Are we
not in a spiritual world vastly more beautiful and happy
than the natural? Why should we return into nature?
into a natural body? into an envelope of flesh and blood,
however purified and etherealized?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These ideas struck me as extremely rational and beautiful.
Having passed the lowest round of the ladder of
being, why should we reverse the laws of development
and descend back to it again? Impossible! The natural
body was only a vehicle of natural life with its thoughts
and emotions. Spiritual thoughts and emotions demand
a spiritual body, a spiritual world. Let those who choose,
wed themselves to the grave and the worm and the dust
and the darkness, and speak of their friends as sleeping
in the cold ground, and satisfy their hungry souls with the
hope of a material resurrection. But their ideas are far,
very far from the truth; and the minds of men will some
day be emancipated from such gross naturalism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Imagine,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“the consternation of the
good spirits, who are happy in heaven, at the thought
that they must leave it, divest themselves of their beautiful
spiritual bodies, and return to the natural world with all
its painful limitations of time and space, resuming their
old cast-off material bodies, which had been long since
resolved into dust and forgotten!”</span>

The thought is monstrous! monstrous! And yet the
poor blinded people in the natural world dwell upon it
as if there were some special consolation, some glorious
promise in it. Incomprehensible freaks of the human
spirit! He who preaches a material resurrection, has
made but one feeble step beyond the infidel who preaches
none at all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Men still in the flesh,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“do not know
that our spiritual world inhabited by spiritual bodies fulfills
all the imperative demands of the soul for a perfect and
final resting-place. We have here life and form, organization
and objects, weight and substance, sounds and
colors all more beautiful and wonderful than those in the
natural world. All these things, invisible, intangible,
inaudible to men, are as real and solid to our senses as
the earth was to you when you were a man upon it.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yet this external world surrounding us is not material
and fixed like yours. It is what we call substantial or
spiritual. It is plastic to spiritual forces. It changes, not
according to your natural laws, but according to the
changes in our own spirits. This is the key to the great
difference which exists between the world you have left
and this glorious one in which you are to live for ever.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Our light here changes. It is day or night with us
according to our own spiritual relations to the great Fountain
of life. In one state of mind we are in the city, in
another in the country. Certain emotions carry us to the
mountain-tops; others place us among the sands and
shells of the sea-shore. In one state of thought we are
walking in flower-gardens of ethereal beauty; in another
we are sitting by rivulets which echo the music of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>own hearts. Thus mountains, fields, rivers, cities, houses,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“All this,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“is so beautiful that it seems impossible.
Liberated now from the thraldom of time and
space, I understand you; but I doubt whether the most
gifted philosopher in Athens can conceive of a world
without time or space; of a world so phantasmagoric in
appearance, yet said to be so genuine and eternal in
reality.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Our spaces are determined,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“by
spiritual affinities. Similarity of thought and feeling determines
presence; dissimilarity makes distance or absence.
When you here direct your thought to any person
on the same plane of life, as we call it, with yourself,
having at the same time a desire to see him, that person
becomes aware of the fact, and, responding to your desire,
is face to face with you at <span class="tei tei-corr">once.</span></span>

I was greatly astonished at the nature and importance
of that intermediate state of life which
I have called the world of spirits. Although
the doctrine of a place of departed spirits, called Sheol
or Hades, is distinctly taught in Scripture and by tradition,
it seems to have made a very feeble impression
on the minds even of the most devout. Most men
think they will go immediately to heaven or to hell
when they die. They are mistaken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The world of spirits receives into its vast bosom the
mighty congregation of the dead from all nations and
climes. It is the first grand receptacle of the whole
human race after death. It is the place of judgment,
special and general. It may be compared to the stomach,
into which all articles of food and drink are collected;
where they are all comminuted, concussed, expressed,
decomposed and digested; and what is found good and
nutritive is taken up into the blood and makes a part of
the living man; while the hard, unwholesome and
innutritious portions, which cannot be dissolved or appropriated,
are cast out of the system as useless or
injurious.
</p>

Let not the reader smile at this anatomical metaphor.
When he gets an interior view of the human body such
as I have enjoyed, he will see that it is an epitome of the
universe; that the mysteries of nature, the wonders of
philosophy and the secrets of heaven are all written
upon its organs and tissues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the present state we are strangely compounded of
good and evil, both hereditary and acquired. He who
thinks that all good people on earth are ready, at death,
to pass at once into heaven without further preparation
and instruction, has formed a mistaken idea of heaven.
Our life in the world of spirits is a judgment upon ourselves,
an unfolding or unrolling of our true characters, a
revelation of our evils under the best possible circumstances;
where by the assistance and instruction of
angelic friends, our imperfections, if our ruling love be
good, can be finally removed, and our souls fitted for
that perfect social organization based upon supreme love
to God and the neighbor, which men in the flesh cannot
understand or even imagine.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> says some one, <span class="tei tei-q">“all that is done for us instantaneously
at death by the miraculous power of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God works always by organic and eternal laws. The
spirit, like the body, grows, develops, progresses by
definite means. Seeds do not expand instantaneously
into trees. A diseased tree is not changed in a moment
into a healthy one. The soul which attains heaven
does so by regular and progressive steps, many of which
(if there has been a commencement on earth) are taken
in the world of spirits. The idea that miraculous power
changes a bad man into a good one, an impure soul
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into a pure one, in a moment of time, in answer to
prayer and faith, is a childish fallacy disastrous to the
life of true religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The population of this world of spirits is immense.
Not only the dead from our world are there, but angelic
spirits from heaven and evil spirits from hell all meet on
this grand arena of spiritual combat and instruction. In
the time of Christ many generations and centuries of
human life were accumulated there; for evil had become
so predominant, and the spiritual element in man so
nearly extinguished, that few or none could be prepared
for heaven. Unless, indeed, God had descended in the
human form and executed a great judgment in that
world, casting the evil into hell and revealing a higher
dispensation of truth, mankind would have perished and
heaven itself have been threatened with chaos.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But all this is myth and mystery to those who have
busied themselves only with the historical movements of
the natural world, not even knowing that the world of
spirits above and around them had far grander historical
movements,—the key and cause of all others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every human being living in the natural world, is
attended by two good and two evil spirits who are living
in the intermediate state. I saw the spirits who had
accompanied me during my life; and, what is singular,
although I had never seen them before, they appeared
like old acquaintances and friends whom I had known
from my youth. Let no man suppose that he will rise
from the dead into the world of spirits, and find himself a
stranger there, friendless and alone.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of spirits should be so near to men, secretly connected
with them by affections and thoughts, flowing down into
them, giving them life and power, and instigating them to
good or evil, and still that the human race should remain
ignorant of the stupendous fact—benighted by all kinds
of false philosophies and false religions.

evil spirits, the power of hell on the earth would be
immeasurably increased. The power of a wicked companion
in the flesh is great; but the power of an evil

every movement of your brain, would be fearful
indeed!”</span>

two realms of being from a conscious intermingling. The
offices and uses of the two worlds are different; one
begins where the other ends. To throw them together

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Because the church is corrupt and dead; the priests
are drunk with the wine of false doctrine; the people
blind and without a shepherd. Therefore iniquity
abounds. The flood-gates of hell are opened. The
world of spirits is crowded with evil ones, who prevent
the good from ascending to heaven, and infuse the most
direful evils and falsities into men on earth. The prophets
are dumb. The magician and the sorcerer are in
the ascendant.</span>

have issued from hell; and there is a general insurrection
of the evil spheres against heaven itself. Unless
these hells are subdued and these evil ones cast out from
the world of spirits, the people on earth will be obsessed,

finite human form and thus come down to his creatures.
He is now engaged in spiritual combats with all these
evil spheres. He is casting these lions of wickedness into
their dens and shutting their mouths. He will purge and
purify the world of spirits, deliver heaven from the

We had been walking in an easterly direction during
the latter part of our conversation. Suddenly there appeared
before us a vast golden-colored sheet or blaze of
light in the east. It was exceedingly brilliant, but at the
same time inexpressibly soft and beautiful. In the centre
of this great luminous field there was a snowy dove with
outspread wings, bearing an olive branch in her mouth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The sphere of the Lord in the world of spirits!”</span>

upon Him; while a revelation was made to me, that this
man whom I had baptized, was truly the Son of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I scarcely heard these words, nor did I understand
them; for my mind was in a state of great agitation. I
had never been pious: I was scarcely even religious in an
external sense. I knew little or nothing of conviction of
sin, penitence or repentance. I was, therefore, amazed
at the new sensations I experienced. There was a painful
sense of my own unregenerate condition; a terrible
self-reproach, self-loathing, self-abasement; and with tears
of contrition and humility I prostrated myself on my
face. It was the sphere of the Lord, the light of heaven,
the Spirit of God penetrating my soul and revealing me
to myself.

This was more incomprehensible to me than anything
yet, but I said nothing; for a sweet calm overspread my
senses, and I became aware of the proximity of holy and
august presences. I looked around me. I saw a great
multitude of good spirits before us. All faces were
directed to a group of figures which occupied a little
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>knoll in their midst. In the centre of that group, I
recognized Jesus of Nazareth!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His face shone as the sun, and his raiment was white
as the light. Dazzling as his form appeared, his features
were perfectly familiar, but etherealized and glorified,
Moses and Elijah stood by him, one on his right hand
and the other on his left. I recognized them at once;
for every Jew has seen the statues and pictures of those
national worthies.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding all that John the Baptist and my father

John, earnestly.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus, the anointed One, is God himself,”</span> said John,
with deep solemnity.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I answered nothing, for my mind was blank with
astonishment. I gazed at the shining form with solemn

teaching his disciples on earth.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“You are not permitted to hear what he says, because

life and happiness will be given you.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">“In the mean time,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“let us be seated
under this beautiful tree, whose boughs make mysterious
music, while I endeavor to bring it clearly to your mind
that Jesus is God; for without an acknowledgment of his
supreme divinity, no genuine spiritual truth can be received.
The idea of God is a fundamental idea; and
every one’s state depends upon it or is determined by it.
If that be false all is false; the mind is a dark chamber
full of motes and cobwebs.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Did not the Jews stone Jesus for affirming his equality
and identity with God? Did not Jesus declare his
pre-existence in saying that before Abraham lived, he
lived? Did he not teach his omnipotence, his infinity,
when he claimed to be one with the Father, and told
his disciples that whoever had seen him, had seen
the Father? Is not his name Immanuel—<span class="tei tei-q">‘God with
us?’</span> ”</span>

of a man, was really the mighty Counselor, the Prince
of Peace, the everlasting Father, Jehovah? Did they
not repeatedly mention the Holy One of Israel, the Messiah
that was to come, under such titles as <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Lord of
hosts,’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘the God of the whole earth,’</span> and other names

in both worlds at the same time? Is He not omnipresent?
ubiquitous? Unlimited by time or space, does
He not manifest Himself to his creatures in all times and

to all created intelligences in all the natural and spiritual
spheres He has created?</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This Jesus, the Messiah, is everywhere. If you ascend
into the heaven next above us, on fitting occasions you would
see Him there in a more glorified form. If you mount
still higher, you will only be coming nearer to Him, and
behold Him in still more transcendent glory. Sometimes
He appears to the angels as a Divine Man standing in the
sun of the spiritual world. It was this truth, transmitted
by tradition to the ancient people of Asia, which gave
rise (as they fell into naturalism) to the worship of the
natural sun and the adoration of fire.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At these words I seemed to see my good and generous
uncle Beltrezzor bowing his head reverently to the
great luminary, from which the celestial face of Jesus
looked down, smiling benediction upon the childlike
old man.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What you tell me,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“of Christ, is so strange
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that at first sight it appears incomprehensible. I perceive,
indeed, that if Jesus be the supreme God of the universe,
He may be seen simultaneously from every stand-point in
the spiritual world, in every sphere, in every society, and
by every individual soul, and everywhere take on a form
accommodated to the spiritual states of those who behold
Him. The difficulty in my mind lies in identifying the
man Jesus whom I knew in Bethany, with this sublime resemblance
of Him that I see in the world of spirits; and
in comprehending that they are one person leading a
simultaneous life in two spheres; and, finally, that this one
person is the Supreme God.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My difficulty is increased when I remember that
Jesus in his earth-life is accustomed to call himself the
Son of God. Although he said plainly that he and the
Father were one, yet he sometimes speaks of the Father
as greater than himself: of praying to the Father for his
disciples; and of ascending to the Father on the consummation
of his work.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He has certainly left the impression upon his hearers
that there are two persons in the Godhead; one higher,
superior, interior; the other, a man among men; and that
between these two there is some mystical union incomprehensible
to the human mind.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Most of his disciples accept this idea blindly, as a
holy mystery. Persons of philosophic culture, who have
studied Jesus as a phenomenon, regard him as a Son of
God, or rather an emanation from God, in the same
sense that Brahma, Osiris, Zoroaster, Moses, and Plato,
are sons of God, or manifestations of divine truth. The
mystical union between Father and Son is supposed to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>an incorporation of the soul of man, by a life of obedience
and goodness, with the essential Divine nature from which
as a parent it was derived.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In estimating the difference,”</span> said John, <span class="tei tei-q">“between
Jesus and other teachers of divine truth, the fact of deepest
significance is, that he was born of a virgin. The soul
of man is derived from his father. Jesus Christ had no
earthly father; therefore, as to his inmost he was different
from all other men. He was not some angelic form returning
into the flesh, or let down from heaven into it;
for that is impossible. And if it were so, his claims to
omnipotence, infinity, eternity, the Godhead, would be
preposterous. No: the soul of Jesus Christ was not introduced
into his earthly body through the agency or intermediation
of any created intelligence. His soul is the
Divine Life, the Supreme Spirit.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Seen from this earthly side, Jesus has no father.
Seen from the spiritual side, he is the Father. Spirits
and angels know Him only as the Father. They have
never heard the term Son, in the earthly sense, applied to
Him. There is no Father beyond him or above him.
Here he never prays to the Father. Here he is himself
recognized as the Father, Jehovah, the I AM.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The term Son of God is used in accommodation to
the sensuous states of the natural mind. It is peculiar to
the earth-life, and cannot rise above the plane which separates
the spiritual from the natural. It is only the human
natural mind, divorcing the spiritual from the natural,
that sees God in a double form, calling Him when invisible,
the Father, and when visible, the Son.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These things are wonderful,”</span> said I; <span class="tei tei-q">“but how to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>explain them to men, who cannot think spiritually, however
much they may think about spiritual things?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is another and profounder reason,”</span> continued
my instructor, <span class="tei tei-q">“why Jesus speaks of himself on earth as
the Son of God, and so frequently prays to an invisible
Father. By subjecting himself in a finite form to the
limitations of time and space, he subjects his own spiritual
consciousness, so far as it is united, to obscuration. In
his human body he thinks and feels as a finite being, the
Son; while at the same moment in his spiritual form
here He thinks and feels as the Divine Wisdom itself.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The grand purpose of the incarnation was, to assume
a human form in which he could be tempted as we are,
in which he could be assaulted by evil spirits and devils;
in which he could conquer death, hell and the grave,
and become the Mediator, the Way, the Life and the
Resurrection. The infestations of evil ones obscure his
mental vision and take away from him at times his
perception of identity with the Father. Thus he has two
earthly states of life, one of glorification or spiritual insight,
when he feels conscious of his Fatherhood; and
one of humiliation, when he is sorely tempted and tried,
and when he lifts his heart in prayer to that Fountain
of love and light which is the centre of his own
infinite bosom.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These things amaze me,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“beyond expression.
Nor do I believe that any human being has any
true conception of the character of Jesus, of the mission
he is filling, or of his plan of redemption. Certainly
none of the thoughts you have communicated to me have
ever dawned on the minds of his disciples.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Nor is it probable,”</span> said John, <span class="tei tei-q">“that mankind will
be prepared, for many centuries, to understand what can
only be comprehended from a spiritual stand-point. The
least portion of the work of Jesus is apparent to men in
the world. The sublime and far more difficult portion
is wholly invisible to them, as it occurs here in the
world of spirits which is not open to their perception.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My angelic friend was about giving me further light on
this lofty theme, when Jesus and the happy multitude
that surrounded him seemed to approach nearer to us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My reader—if this manuscript ever finds a reader—may
wonder why I did not approach the Divine Man
and speak to him, after I had discovered that my earthly
friend was the Supreme Being manifested in the human
form. Ah! they know nothing of the sphere of the
Lord! I could not even lift up my eyes to his feet. I
was overwhelmed with wonder and awe. Had not so
many other spirits been present to engage my attention,
to divert my thoughts and to impart courage and life to
me, I should have swooned and fallen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Oppressed by the heavenly sphere, whose nearer approach
I was not prepared for, I seized my father by the
hand and he led me away. The scene faded behind us;
and we went down into a little green valley filled with
small white flowers and watered by a little brook. There
I was freed from the terrible sense of oppression, and recovered
my composure. We sat down in this valley of
humiliation, where the small white flowers were the innocent
thoughts of the new life, and the musical voice of the
brook was a hymn of contrition.

the mind and pains the heart, so as to almost suffocate
the life within us?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When the sphere of heaven approaches those who
are in evil and falsity,”</span> answered my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“it occasions
intense pain in their interiors, and they cry out; <span class="tei tei-q">‘Why
art thou come hither, O Christ! to torment us?’</span> Such is
the judgment: and the wicked call upon the mountains
and the rocks to hide them from the wrath of God.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wrath of God! monstrous conception!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the gentle breath of the Divine Love which is
converted into a burning fire when it enters the perverted
and corrupt forms of their own souls!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The same sphere of divine light approaching those
who have some remnants of good and truth, and who
can be saved, produces a profound self-abasement, a
trembling contrition, a suffocation of the old life with all
its wicked desires, and an inexpressible longing for a new
life of purity, peace and love.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I now understood it all. I felt the self-abasement, the
contrition, the inexpressible longing. The sun had already
disappeared. The sun of the spiritual world does
not rise and set like ours; but it brightens or pales in
appearance with the changing states of the spirit. Then
shone out innumerable stars in a blue dome, like the
friendly faces of cherubim and seraphim smiling on us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length the wearied new-comer into the spiritual
world passed into that mysterious realm of profoundest
sleep, which is common to all worlds, and in which the
unconscious soul is alone with God.

When I awoke, the sun was shining through a
golden mist: the dew glittered like a rainbow
fallen upon the grass and flowers: the air was
full of sweet odors and the voices of birds: a strange
warmth and vigor pervaded my body, and a delightful
activity reigned in my soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“the first awakening thought
should be always a prayer.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He then repeated those beautiful words by which
Jesus taught his disciples to pray. I will not describe the
spiritual phenomena which attended this prayer. The
multitude of ideas and influxes and perceptions which
were crowded into every sentence, would be incomprehensible
to men. It seemed to be an epitome of the
universe, and to bring the soul into loving contact with
all the spheres of the divine creation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Has Jesus taught that prayer in the world of spirits
also?”</span> I inquired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes. This prayer is the universal prayer which binds
the heavens and all the angels together. It is the holiest
thing of religion. It descends from God to angels and
men; and blessed is he who receives it into his heart!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We are now ready,”</span> continued my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>divine permission and under the divine protection, to
explore some of the evil spheres which have congregated
in the world of spirits, and which infuse their deadly
poisons into men in the world. You will then understand
a part of the great work which Christ is performing
in this intermediate state.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thereupon he examined my face, head and hands with
the utmost minuteness. A man’s whole life is written
upon these; and angels, having a perfect knowledge of
correspondences, the key of symbolism, can read from
them your whole history as from a book.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I perceived,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that in your earth-life you
have been brought into contact with the corrupt sphere
of the Jewish Church, with the sensuousness of Grecian
art and philosophy, with the splendors of Roman ambition,
and with the ancient and subtle power of Egyptian
magic. You have seen these things on the natural or
earthly side. I will show them to you on the spiritual
and interior side, so that you may comprehend the dreadful
condition of the human race, and see the necessity of
the Divine incarnation.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The geography, if we may use the expression, of the
world of spirits is ever changing. The Church of the
Lord, meaning those who come from the world and
possess a divine revelation, always occupies the centre;
other nations with different religions are arranged in successive
zones around it; the farthest off in the circumference
being those pagans who have received the least
portion of the divine light and life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the mutations of the world,”</span> said my father.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Those remotest people, away off in the darkness and
cold of the circumference, were once the chosen people
of God, his church, occupying the centre, immediately
under the down-falling rays of the Divine Sun. They
proved faithless to their trust. They became so evil that
a terrible spiritual catastrophe overwhelmed them, described
as a flood,—for they were engulfed in a flood of
falsities. They were the antediluvians, of celestial genius,
the most richly endowed, the most beautiful of all; and
now their descendants, the most hideous and debased, are
the black and bronzed barbarians and savages of the
world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We are accustomed to think,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“that those
lower types of mankind are the last created, and therefore
the least perfect.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No! they are the descendants of the first created
and most perfect. They are not imperfect but degraded
types. Imperfect types would progress upward and
onward by natural law. These barbarians of Africa will
never make the least advance until new causes which do
not now exist, are put in operation. This great mystery
of the Divine Providence will not be solved for many,
many ages to come.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“After the destruction of that antediluvian church,
another succeeded, possessing a written Word, a splendid
ceremonial and boundless treasures of spiritual wisdom.
They also forfeited their birth-right and betrayed their
trust. Their judgment occurred in this world of spirits
when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by fire.
Abraham and his family were the remnant saved from
that church for the beginning of a new, as Noah and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his family had been the remnant saved from the <span class="tei tei-corr">preceding.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The descendants of this lost church compose chiefly
the nationalities of Asia. They have remained for ages
and will remain for ages to come in a stationary,
semi-petrified condition, possessing no genuine truth, no
vital religion, no element of progress; but living upon
fables and myths which are the fragments of spiritual
truth, whose interior light has long been lost to their
understandings.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“For many centuries now of natural time, the Jewish
Church has held the centre of the world of spirits. It
also has become thoroughly corrupt, and is about to be
removed to the circumference. Its great judgment is
impending; its destruction approaches; but of this, that
church itself is profoundly ignorant.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this conversation we had ascended by insensible
degrees to the summit of a high mountain. I was
astonished at the splendid panorama spread out beneath
us. It was the whole land of Canaan, from the Jordan
on the east to the borders of Philistia on the west; from
Damascus and Antioch gleaming away to the north,
down to the great desert that frowned along the southern
boundary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Immediately beneath us was a city of Jerusalem, ten
times as large as our earthly capital; and a holy temple
of corresponding proportions, all transcending in glory
and grandeur anything ever seen on earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“the creation of spiritual
fantasy, the imaginary heaven of the Jews, which will
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pass away like a scroll at the breath of the Lord when
He comes in judgment upon them.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You seem astonished,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“that spirits
should reproduce around themselves these spiritual semblances
of the cities and countries they have left behind.
Nothing is more simple and rational. These people are
gross and sensual in their nature, with little or nothing
of the celestial or spiritual about them. They loved
material things exclusively; their thoughts never rose
above outward, civil, and political affairs. Here their
interior life is reproduced in exteriors. Therefore they
create around themselves their old homes, cities, and
countries; and re-enact, as far as possible, their earthly
life, because all their affections and thoughts are earthly.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This mountain,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“upon which we are standing
puzzles me; for there is no similar elevation in the
neighborhood of Jerusalem.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This mountain,”</span> answered my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“is symbolical
of the lofty state of spiritual pride and presumption in
which the Jewish Church now is—a state of self-glorification
which precedes its judgment and final destruction.
It is only from this height, corresponding to their own
spiritual state, that you can see the holy city and temple
as they appear to them.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is it strange that a people, so gross, so unspiritual, so
near their extinction as a church, should be so inflated
with spiritual and theological conceit? They appear in
their own eyes to have the most glorious city, the most
holy church, and the most august ceremonials that ever
existed; accounting all others unfit for heaven and unworthy
of the Divine favor.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It was on the pinnacle of that colossal temple which
you now see, that the evil spirit placed Jesus, and attempted
to infuse into his heart the arrogant self-glorification
of the corrupt priesthood, which imagines itself the
special care of all the angels of heaven.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We had always supposed that that temptation occurred
on the temple in Jerusalem.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, no!”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“the temptations of the
Lord always occur in the world of spirits. Evil spirits
do not move around upon the temples and mountain-tops
of the natural world. The Lord’s spiritual senses were
opened into this world, which is the scene of his trials,
his temptations, his combats with hell; and will be the
scene of his final glorification and ascension.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These ideas are all new to me,”</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“but very
rational.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will now see,”</span> my father continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“how this
imaginary heaven of the Jews, with its proud and worldly
magnates, appears in the genuine light of heaven. An
invisible angel accompanies us, who is commissioned to
let in the heavenly light upon these scenes, to show you
the internal and real character of this church.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thereupon a ray of white light seemed to shoot down
from the zenith. A black cloud immediately arose from
the Salt Sea, and spread itself like a canopy over the
whole land. Fearful thunderings and red lightnings
issued from the bosom of this terrible cloud. The whole
country around became a desolation—a dreary waste full
of stone-heaps and pitfalls. The holy city sank into the
earth; and in its place there rose a great lake, black as a
mountain tarn unruffled by the wind. Floating in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>midst of it was the gorgeous temple converted into a huge
wooden house or Noah’s ark, from the innumerable windows
of which looked out the hideous faces of wild beasts
and the heads of enormous serpents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was at first terrified at these sights; but my father
observed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is a representation, a pictorial prophecy of a
reality yet to come, before Christ has finished his conquering
work in the world of spirits. These people do not
see the things we see. This heavenly light has come into
our minds that we may discover what their interior life
really is,—devoid of all spiritual vitality; desolate, dark,
lurid; full of evil beasts and unclean birds and creeping
things.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This sphere of ecclesiastical pride and presumption is
not peculiar to the Jewish Church or nation. It is predominant
in all religions, churches and individuals, when
the religious instincts are satisfied and delighted with
grandeur, power, numbers, fashion, wealth and glory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What will be the effect,”</span> I inquired, <span class="tei tei-q">“of this disastrous
judgment in the world of spirits, upon the Jewish
nation in the natural world?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There will be fearful dissensions and conflicts; wars
within and without; the city and the temple will be destroyed;
the country made desolate; the people scattered
as exiles and vagabonds among all nations. Their
descendants, coming into the world of spirits, will recede
toward the circumference among the pagans. A new
church springing up among other nations, will take the
central place, and give rise upon earth, after great struggles,
to a purer religion and a nobler civilization.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will now see, in symbolic representation, the
three great classes into which the Church will be dissolved
at its judgment.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then there appeared before us a great many domestic
animals; oxen, horses, asses, camels, sheep, fowls, etc.;
all mingled together in confusion, and all looking poor,
jaded, filthy and wretched.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These are the beasts of burden,”</span> said my father;
<span class="tei tei-q">“the ignorant and innocent masses, presided over by a
corrupt and cruel theocracy, which desecrates the name
of God by imposing upon his children a spiritual despotism.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Advance nearer to these creatures, and you will
behold a wonderful sight, such as can never appear in
the natural world, but is common enough in the world
of spirits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We came nearer, and lo! all the animals were found
to be men and women. Some of their forms and faces
seemed taken from my memory; for I thought I recognized
the crowds which followed Jesus in the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“From these people,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“the remnant
will be taken—the remnant about which the prophets
speak so often. This remnant of Israel, starting with
the apostles chosen by Christ, will be the seed and
starting-point of a new Church.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such are the forms of those who are interiorly
good. Observe now the forms of those who are interiorly
wicked.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The former scene passed away and three wild beasts
appeared standing at the mouth of an immense black
cavern, in front of which many human bones were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scattered. The animals were a wild boar, a wolf and a
tiger, all of gigantic size and terrible ferocity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We advanced nearer to these also, and they changed
into men; the wild boar into Caiaphas, the high
priest; the wolf into the cunning and cruel Magistus;
and the tiger into the robber Barabbas. The meaning
of this tableaux I perceived intuitively without explanation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Between these two extremes,”</span> continued my father,
<span class="tei tei-q">“is a great class who are in mixed states of good and
evil. Their sufferings will be severe before they can put
off either kind of life so as to live entirely in the other;
for a separation of good and evil must be effected,—if
not upon earth, at least in the world of spirits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A sandy wilderness then arose to view, in which I saw
but two figures; a zebra, wild, beautiful, intractable,
snuffing proudly the air of the desert; and a white dove
which was struggling frantically to escape from the jaws
of a monstrous serpent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These I approached more eagerly; for I was impelled
by an earnest desire to caress the beautiful zebra, and
to rescue the dove from the fangs of the serpent. They
changed also in the twinkling of an eye. The zebra was
our friend the Son of the Desert, and the dove was Mary
Magdalen. As the latter stepped forward, a shining and
beautiful woman, the serpent shriveled and fell behind
her like a black garment cast upon the ground.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the last picture faded away, my father resumed his
instructions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The scenes you have witnessed are phantasmagoric,
but symbolical and full of spiritual truth. They illustrate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the law of appearances which governs in the spiritual
world. The phenomenal world around us, animal, vegetable
and mineral, is all representative of the life within
us; not by accident or with confusion, but according
to fixed and eternal laws.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The sphere of life radiates from a spirit like heat
from the sun, or like perfume from a flower. It flows
forth and falls into successive zones or belts of spiritual
substance, in each of which it produces some spiritual form
representative of itself. Outside of his human sphere,
the life of a spirit takes form in the first zone as an animal,
in the second as a planet or flower, in the third as a
mineral, a stone, a drop of water, a cloud, a star.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The life which animates a wicked spirit becomes a
corresponding wild beast in the first zone; a loathsome
fungus in the second; a poisonous mineral in the third.
The sweet spiritual life of a good heart becomes the innocent
lamb in one zone; the beautiful rose in the next;
the brilliant gem in the <span class="tei tei-corr">last.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Observe, however, that each spirit always appears to
himself in the human form; and always so to others when
they are near him. He only takes on these typical or
correspondential forms in the eyes of others, when he
recedes to or approaches from a distance.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What a deep philosophy you are unfolding!”</span> I exclaimed.
<span class="tei tei-q">“I see already in what you have told me the
germs of a thousand brilliant ideas. Oh that I could teach
these beautiful things in the porticoes of Athens! How
they would ravish the Grecian heart!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You are mistaken,”</span> said my father. <span class="tei tei-q">“Some simple
soul from whom you least expected it, would accept your
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>doctrines, weeping for joy. The great, the rich, the
learned, the powerful, would scornfully reject them as
fables or dreams.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That is strange and sad.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—but it is true. The mind which is wedded to
falsities in religion or philosophy, is proud, self-reliant,
self-satisfied, bigoted and intolerant. The genuine truth
which makes the soul free, makes it also liberal and
loving.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will the Jews on earth reject the Messiah, proving
his mission as he does by stupendous miracles?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes: miracles avail nothing with the unbelieving.
Truth is not seen merely because it is truth. No truth is
received or seen but that which corresponds to some love
in the heart. The hatred which these Jewish spirits feel
for holy things, will descend by influx into the priests
and scribes at Jerusalem: and the tender seed of the New
Dispensation will be sown in darkness and watered with
tears and blood.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do not suppose,”</span> added my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“that spirits and
angels have any special power to foresee the future. Oh
no! We only live nearer to the Fountain of causes, and
reason more acutely from cause to effect.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I treasured these strange things in my mind, having
only a faint perception of either their truth or value. I
was especially surprised at the fact, that a church could
actually come to an end, a dispensation be spiritually closed
and a new one inaugurated, while the adherents of the
old were in the full flush of power and numbers, and
regarded themselves as the favored repositories and faithful
interpreters of divine truth!

After these things we were taken up another
high mountain, whence we had a view of all
the kingdoms in the world of spirits at once.
Hither it was that Jesus was carried by the evil spirit who
offered him all this power and glory, if he would fall
down and worship him. There is no mountain in the
natural world from which such an outlook were possible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This great height,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“represents the
infernal sphere of self-aggrandizement, which aspires to
universal dominion. It is that ambition which corrodes
the heart with envious passion so long as anything remains
unconquered. This spirit is common to nations and individuals,
to the greatest and the least. This mountain
rears its awful summit in every human breast. This is
the spiritual mountain which is to be cast into the sea
by faith.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looking down, I now beheld a city of Rome as before
I had seen a city of Jerusalem. Beautiful, shadowy pictures
of cities, homes of spirits, vastly magnified and made
glorious with ethereal colors! Man cannot imagine the
splendid creations which spirits can instantaneously produce
from the plastic substance of the spiritual world.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>These cities and countries, however, are peculiar to the
intermediate state. They do not exist in heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Romans risen from the dead had reconstructed
their imperial city of precious stones, so that it always
shone from afar as if some grand illumination were
going on, whose splendors were again reflected from the
clouds which floated above it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We looked into this marvelous city, its capital and
palaces, its temples and amphitheatres. The great avenues
were crowded with a vast and gorgeous procession. Many
kings and queens and nobles were walking in chains,
brought as prisoners from so many conquered countries.
The treasures of these plundered captives were borne by
thousands of slaves of all colors and nationalities, in
massive and curiously-carved vessels of gold and silver.
Specimens of wild animals from all regions of the Roman
world, drawn in gilded cages, and of the more wonderful
plants and flowers carried upon the shoulders of men,
and screened from the sun by flaming canopies of silk,
added to the picturesqueness and grandeur of the scene.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Roman senators, generals and magnates were seen
heading the different divisions of this vast multitude, riding
in blazing chariots drawn by superb horses richly caparisoned.
On both sides of the captives marched the victorious
armies of Rome; so that the very air above them was
golden with the flash of helmets, spears and shields, and
the gleam of Roman eagles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These were the spirits of that vain-glorious and indomitable
race who had changed the geography of the natural
world, and were now celebrating their victories with transcendent
magnificence in the intermediate state. The sphere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of their interior character was wafted to my spiritual perceptions,
and I felt as I did in the Hall of Apollo when
Hortensius and his guests fixed their haughty and contemptuous
gaze upon Anthony and myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How unutterably base, cruel and sensual,”</span> exclaimed
my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the spirit of man when he loves himself
supremely, and overreaches and overrides his fellow-creatures.
Behold the spiritual side to this magnificent
exterior!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thereupon the light from a higher sphere streamed
down, and the pomp, the glory, the beauty of the whole
scene disappeared. We beheld a vast crowd of beggars
in filthy rags, and a confused heap of low buildings made
of mud and straw. The proud and fierce Romans were
all slaves themselves, wearing long chains and driven by
infernal spirits in the shape of grinning apes. Where the
Capitol had stood, appeared a pool of blood-colored
water, in which a dragon of hideous dimensions lay,
spouting from his mouth a stream of fire. A lurid twilight
hung over all, prognosticating a wild and tempestuous
night.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“will be the fate of ambition
when the Lord comes in judgment. Let us now descend
to a lower region, and see a people greater than these,
but who have sunk into darker depths; a people now destitute
of spiritual pride or civil ambition; a degenerate,
effeminate, corrupt race, dead to all genuine and ennobling
aspirations, and immersed like beasts in the life of the
senses.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We seemed to go down to the sea-coast—for the blue
ocean girdles also the world of spirits. Soon we came
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into the sphere of the Grecian souls who had risen from
the dead, and who had reconstructed about them, according
to spiritual laws, their own charming and ethereal country.
The scene was not far from Athens, whose marble-crowned
Acropolis gleamed in the distance, with clouds more beautiful
than itself floating above it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The poetic faculty, full of the inspiration of Grecian
art, can alone appreciate what I next witnessed. The
Hall of Apollo in the palace of Hortensius was a beggarly
chamber in comparison with this great hall of nature in
which Pan presided, and in which earth, sky and ocean
had each its part. The guests also of the luxurious
Roman were mere schoolboys in comparison with the
august assembly before us, which was gathered to a feast
in the imaginary heaven of the Greeks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We seemed to be standing on a hill that sloped and fell
by beautiful green terraces down to the silver beach of a
placid sea. The summit of that hill was long, broad and
level, and crowned with a grove of extraordinary beauty.
The trees were far apart, and rose like emerald columns
to a great height before they branched. Their foliage
was pruned and led by threads of invisible wire to intertwine
overhead, forming a delicate arch for a roof. The
ground was carpeted with an inwrought tissue of living
flowers, which yielded elastically to the tread, sending up
continually a delicious perfume.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this immense grove were spread a thousand tables
seemingly of solid precious stones, and crowned with
great vases of wine and cups of crystal, and adorned with
ethereal fruits and flowers. At these tables were seated
or reclining thousands and thousands of the ancient heroes
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and heroines of Greece, served by thousands of beautiful
nymphs, Dryads and Naiads, who had left the woods
and the waters to bestow their charms on these happy
souls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The gods and goddesses were also in attendance; for
heaven and earth were thrown together in such admirable
confusion that each partook the qualities of the other.
The sky and the air were literally full of divinities. On
a rose-and-purple cloud condensed into a throne, and
lowered half-way between the ceiling and the floor, sat
Venus, crowned with myrtles and presiding at the feast.
The Graces were kneeling at her feet, while her swans
and doves were grouped about her. Near by stood
Cupid twanging his bow, and laughing at the sight of his
empty quiver; for every heart in the crowd had been
pierced by one of his golden arrows.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Looking out to the sea, we saw Neptune, of colossal
proportions, riding in his chariot constructed of shells,
and drawn by horses with brazen hoofs and gilded manes.
Myriads of sea-nymphs and sea-monsters sported and
gamboled about him, sometimes in the air, sometimes on
the shining surface of the deep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In mid-sky Apollo in person drove the chariot of the
sun, attended by the Muses and the flying Hours. In the
west, Iris the messenger of Juno, planted her rainbow on a
passing cloud, and smiled in colors to the world. Afar
off, in the east, the Seasons had opened the massive Gates
of Cloud, and we had a glimpse of the old Olympian gods
in conclave august, feasting upon ambrosial food.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thousands of these beautiful figures were nude; and I
saw the spiritual models which had inspired and
immor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>talized Grecian art. Thousands also were draped, and
with such infinite variety and beauty, that it seemed no
work of human ingenuity, but as if Nature herself had
invested them with her forms and colors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, my father!”</span> said I excitedly, <span class="tei tei-q">“surely this is
real; this is heaven. These things will not vanish also,
or change into something hideous and terrible.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A shade of sadness came over my father’s face; for he
saw that the subtile and powerful sphere of this Grecian
nature-worship had awakened the activities of my own
sensuous life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, my son; these are phantasms. These are
wicked Grecian spirits who are personating their gods
and goddesses, their heroes and heroines. You see
before you what wonders spirits can achieve by magic
and fantasy. This is the sphere which flows into and
governs the present population of Greece. These spirits
would, if they could, obsess and control the human <a name="corr219" id="corr219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">race.</span>
The interior state of these souls is terrible.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“O, do not show it to me yet,”</span> I exclaimed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
me contemplate a little longer this marvelous scene.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When all these spirits are judged,”</span> continued my
father, <span class="tei tei-q">“and cast out of the world of spirits, the Greece
and Rome of the natural world will become feeble and
death-stricken. Their oracles will become silent; their
arts will fail; their glory perish; their civilization decay.
Their very languages will die. Their exact modes of
thought will no more be possible to men. Ages of
bondage and darkness will ensue, after the light they
have perverted and the liberty they have profaned.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I scarcely heard these last words; for the vast
assem<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bly of gods and men, which had been in comparative
repose, became suddenly animated by a wild excitement.
There issued from the cool and leafy forests on all sides
a crowd of beautiful nymphs headed by Diana, resplendent
as a statue of pearl, clad in an apron of green
leaves and flowers, and with a constellation of fire-flies in
her hair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Her merry troop of nymphs, arrayed like herself, were
flying in affected fear from the jolly god Bacchus, who
appeared in pursuit, crowned with vine leaves and berries
and drawn by his Indian tigers striped with ebony and
gold. He was followed by a rabble rout of Fauns and
Satyrs and bacchanalian revelers, male and female.
This beautiful chaos threw itself pell-mell, reeling and
whirling and dancing, shouting and singing, into the
midst of the brilliant assembly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A scene of the wildest carnival followed. The heroes
and heroines caught the contagious frenzy, and soon
all were entangled in the embraces of the maddest dance
that ever was witnessed. Neptune and his water-nymphs
sprang high into the air to view the scene; and all the
deities in Olympus crowded down to the Gates of Cloud,
which they illumined afar off by the sun-like radiance of
their presence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was gazing on this scene with the utmost astonishment,
when my eyes fell suddenly upon Helena, the
beautiful daughter of Calisthenes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My father,”</span> said I, with profound emotion, <span class="tei tei-q">“do
you not see that superb figure of a woman more beautiful
than all these goddesses, leaning against yonder tree and
clapping her hands with delight at the drunken Bacchus
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>making love to Venus? That is Helena of Athens! the
dream of my life, the idol of my soul.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not so,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is a phantasm—a spirit
resembling your earthly Helena; perhaps some cunning
Syren who has assumed her form to allure you to herself.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“impossible!”</span> feasting my eyes
and heart on the lovely apparition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Every one,”</span> continued my monitor, <span class="tei tei-q">“fresh from the
natural world, who enters this magical and fantastic
sphere, sees, or thinks he sees, some wondrous woman,
whom he declares to be the idol and dream of his
soul. Beware, my son, of these seductive emotions.
The light of heaven will dispel for us all these illusions.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no!”</span> said I, wildly, <span class="tei tei-q">“it cannot; it must not.
This, this, is heaven, and all else is illusion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My heart beat with passionate fervor, and I sprang forward
to meet my beloved. My father suddenly disappeared
from my sight! In the spiritual world, when two
persons enter into totally different states of thought and
feeling, they mutually vanish from each other’s sight.
Heaven and hell are thus separated, and the existence
of each is even unknown to the other. I noticed the
fact that my father had vanished; but I cared nothing
about it, for my infatuated soul thought only of Helena.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I advanced toward her. She turned upon me a look
of beautiful recognition; and stretching out her ivory
arms, exclaimed with a sun-burst of her old bewitching
smiles:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My boy-lover of Bethany! welcome! I thought I
had killed you with love!”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then love me back into life!”</span> I exclaimed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When an appalling change came suddenly over all
things. The light of heaven streamed down upon me,
and those other lights were turned into shadows, the
beauty into ugliness, the joy into horror, life into death.
The deities became phantom skeletons grinning as they
fled away into the darkness. The men assumed the forms
of filthy swine or goats, and the women those of writhing
vipers. The charming creature into whose delicate arms
I was about throwing myself, became a scaly serpent of
frightful size. I fell swooning to the ground, with the terrible
sensations of one who is falling headlong from a
precipice into the sea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I returned slowly and painfully to consciousness, like
one who has had a long sleep and harassing dreams, and
finds it difficult to pick up the fallen thread of his yesterday’s
life. I found myself pillowed on a soft green bank
in a delicious atmosphere of repose. Without opening my
eyes I reverted to all that had happened, and a feeling
of desolation came over me, and a sense of deep shame
and contrition. What a revelation of the sensual affinities
of my own interior nature! What blindness! What <a name="corr222" id="corr222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">madness</span>!
Alas! how low had I fallen! I was afraid to meet
my father and the good John. I was wretched.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My meditations were interrupted by the voice of some
one near me, singing in low sweet tones, pervaded by
a certain divine sadness, the beautiful words of Scripture:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy:</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">When I fall I shall arise:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">When I sit in darkness</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">The Lord shall be a light unto me.”</span></div>
</div>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then another voice overhead, clearer, more thoughtful,
more musical than the first, sang sweetly:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Jehovah upholdeth all that fall,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">And raiseth up all who are bowed down.”</span></div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thereupon the first voice near me proceeded in the
same low sweet tones full of sadness:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“But as for me, my feet were almost gone,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">My steps had well nigh slipped.”</span></div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The higher, nobler voice continued the heavenly consolations
of Scripture:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Nevertheless I am ever with thee!”</span></div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The voices, the music, the refrain, the holy words of
the Psalmist, stirred in the tenderest manner the very
depths of my soul. I wept. A new faith, a new hope, a
new divine resolution were born within me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Like a singer who has been overcome with emotion,
but dries her tears and resumes her singing,—the sadness
overshadowed by a modest courage,—the first voice was
heard again:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Thou hast held me by my right hand,</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">And afterward shalt receive me into glory.”</span></div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then there was a burst of divine music as from a hidden
choir of angels, in which the two voices joined; and
this was the hymn:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 6.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“The Lord is my Shepherd;</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 6.00em">I shall not want:</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">He leadeth me beside the still waters;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 6.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">He restoreth my soul!”</span></div>
</div>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The strains died softly away, lingering long on my
charmed ear and leaving my heart in a sacred calm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I prayed with intense earnestness:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“From self-love and the love of the world; from self-righteousness,
presumption and hypocrisy; from pride,
ambition and sensuality; all of which I have seen so fearfully
unmasked:</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Good Lord! deliver me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I opened my eyes, and my father and the seraph-faced
forerunner of Jesus stood before me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The latter took my hand tenderly in his own, and
said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“All the experiences of life, both in the world of men
and in the world of spirits, are given to teach us the difference
between good and evil, between the true and the
false; to show us the deformity of sin and the beauty of
holiness; to deliver our souls from the bondage of hell,
and lift them into the peace of heaven.”</span>

We had then a long conversation about the
mysteries of regeneration or the new birth,
scarcely any of which are known to mankind,
or would be believed if they were revealed. This knowledge
is so peculiarly spiritual and angelic that it seems
useless for me to say anything about it. If a church on
earth ever comprehends these divine arcana, it will only
be when the Lord sees fit to open his heavens anew, and
to unfold the spiritual meaning of his Word.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You have now seen,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“the three
great spheres which represent the three degrees of the
human mind. That Jesus Christ met and resisted the
powers of hell in all these spheres, is shown in his temptations
in the wilderness. By conquering these evil
spheres in his human form and through his divine power,
He is enabled henceforth to deliver all men from similar
infestations. This was the great purpose of his incarnation.
His temptation will appear to men as an historical
event enacted at a certain time and space. To angels it
seems a condensed statement of his whole spiritual life,
of his entire redemptive work, from the assumption of
humanity to his final and perfect <span class="tei tei-corr">glorification.</span>”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Who is the devil,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“that was capable of
tempting the Holy One so severely?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The devil is no single <a name="corr226" id="corr226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">individual</span>, but the whole
combined evil world, speaking and acting through one
medium. You seem surprised; but nothing is more
common in the spiritual world than for a whole society
of spirits, even millions in number, to think, feel, and
express themselves simultaneously through one of their
number.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you not remember that when Jesus asked a
certain maniac his name, the devil within him replied:</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘My name is Legion: for we are many.’</span> ”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This led to the strange subject of demoniac possession.
I told my father that the Greek philosophers
and physicians, who were considered the profoundest
thinkers in the world, scouted the idea of evil spirits
taking possession of men. They attributed all such cases
to the effect of physical disease.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“They know nothing whatever,”</span> said my guide, <span class="tei tei-q">“of
the relation between spirit and matter. Their philosophy
of man, history, and nature is superficial and
false. Their boasted light is darkness to our spiritual
perceptions, and their scientific verbiage the merest
<span class="tei tei-corr">babble.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is true, my son, that devils are continually
aspiring to break through from hell into the world of
spirits; and by means of evil spirits in this world,
especially those fresh from the earth, to possess and
govern men in the natural world. If the divine hand
were not put forth to arrest this influx of hell into the
world of nature, three centuries would not elapse before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all mankind would be imbecile or insane, and would
destroy each other like wild beasts.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mankind,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“are totally ignorant of the
fearful dangers which hang over them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Of course they are. These dangers come from the
unseen spiritual side. They know nothing and believe
nothing of the unseen.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Can you tell me anything of the spiritual philosophy
of magic?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A sphere inconceivably subtle and wicked! It obtained
its first foothold in Egypt ages before the historic
period, and has penetrated thence, under different forms
and names, into all the countries of the world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We had some painful experiences with it soon after
your departure from the natural world; but my philosophic
studies at Athens led me to suppose that magic
was an imposture based upon absurd superstitions.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Magic, my son, is at present a fearful reality. It is
the means by which the wicked can summon around
them the worst spirits, and obtain control over man and
nature. By its means they can overcome physical obstacles;
can see and hear at incredible distances; can
produce dreams and illusions; can make one thing appear
another; effect transformations which seem miraculous;
call up the spirits of the dead; take absolute possession
of the fancy and the will; and control their victim in all
his thoughts and actions. They can give wise answers
and frequently foretell future events. They can imitate
good and heavenly things with such marvelous accuracy,
as to impose themselves as illumined teachers and prophets
upon mankind.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How could such a fearful thing have originated?
Whence is its power?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“From the perversion and profanation of holy things;
from the abuse of the knowledge of correspondence, which
is the secret bond between spirit and matter, and for that
reason is now concealed from mankind. When the sons
of Aaron put strange fire upon the altar of the Lord, they
were consumed. When the sons of the prophet shred the
wild vine into the pot, there was death in the pottage.
That strange fire, that wild vine is magic. Magic is the
perversion of truth—the science and the religion of hell.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Can you foresee the future of this terrible power?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—so far as we can infer that certain material
effects must flow in time from certain spiritual causes.
The great judgment which Christ is now executing in this
world of spirits, will cast all these magical powers into
hell and shut them up for ever. This is a part of the
saving work of the Redeemer. He delivers men, not
from the punishment but from the bondage of sin. Magic
will then cease upon earth. The fragments and shadows
of it may annoy mankind for ages; but its central power
will have been bruised and broken, and it will become
such barefaced superstition, trickery, and sleight-of-hand,
that future generations will find it difficult to believe that
it ever was anything else.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come!”</span> he added; <span class="tei tei-q">“I am permitted to show you
one of the old Egyptians at his work.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now descended into a dark cavern which appeared
on our left, but which I had not noticed before. It
sloped downward, with ragged black rocks protruding
from its walls. The atmosphere was at first so stifling
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that I could hardly proceed. We emerged after a while
into a level country under a sky of a dark gray color. A
blood-red sun, never setting, stood low in the west, casting
a lurid light over all things. Our path was along the
bank of a large river, moving sluggishly and darkly between
gigantic reeds and rushes. Huge crocodiles and
monstrous beasts I had never seen before, lay here and
there, half in the mud and half in the water. Away in
the distance rose many colossal forms, pyramids, sphynxes,
obelisks, palaces, temples—vast shadows as it were against
the sky. Now and then we passed a statue of stone or
bronze, higher than the tallest trees, and so sad, stern
and lifelike, it was difficult not to believe that it was the
lost soul of some old Egyptian king, doomed to perpetual
misery in the outward form of eternal repose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You must know,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“that to enable us
to enter these awful gateways of hell, an invisible guard
of thousands of angels is necessary.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was relieved by this thought; for a sensation of fear
had already begun to oppress me. I had learned enough
of the spiritual world to know that all this wild and
grotesque scenery was the outbirth of the life and memories
of evil spirits, and could be dissipated in a moment,
or changed into something horrible by the revealing light
of heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We now came to a great palace which seemed built of
ebony, with foundations, doors, and cornices of bronze.
The gates leading to its courtyard were of immense size,
and constructed of dingy brass. A strange inscription
ran across the arch, which I asked my father to interpret.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the Ten Commandments reversed,
representing the laws which govern in this evil
sphere. Much of it is too dim for one to read; but see!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt kill.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt steal.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt commit adultery.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hold!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“what profanation! what blasphemy.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, my son! Hell is the opposite of heaven.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The courtyard was laid out in curious geometric figures,
and adorned with many extraordinary plants and flowers,
but mainly of yellow and purple hues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Flowers at the doorway of hell! I thought that
flowers were the children of heaven, the fragments of
divine wisdom showered upon men in the disguise of
beautiful forms, fragrances and colors.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“So they are,”</span> said my father; <span class="tei tei-q">“and the floral
kingdom here is antipodal to the floral kingdom in
heaven; the concentration of all that is malignant and
baleful in the thoughts and feelings of the inhabitants of
that doleful place.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shuddered as I passed these infernal flowers; and we
mounted the iron steps of the palace, walking between
the statues of two great brazen bulls as we entered the
hall.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A servant came forward to receive us, of such hideous
form that I started back in terror. He was nearly naked,
and thousands of hieroglyphic figures had been burned
into his body in black and red colors. His face was the
face of an embalmed person, long dead, shriveled and
ghastly.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While we were speaking to this frightful personage, a
hoarse, sepulchral voice issued from a half-open door:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Bring them in. I have felt their coming.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We passed into a chamber of immense size,—for everything
in the shadowy world seemed to me colossal. I
instantly perceived that it was the counterpart of the
chamber of magic in the house of Magistus, so minutely
described to me by my sister Martha.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold the source of inspiration to Simon Magus!”</span>
said I to myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I recognized all the objects mentioned by the eyewitnesses
of that remarkable scene between Simon and
the magicians; the marble platform; the black table
with the zodiac upon it; the images on the wall. Even
the leopard and serpent were there. The magician was
an old man, stern-featured, cruel-eyed, worn and wasted,
with some personal resemblance to Simon Magus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have had violent pains about my heart and difficult
breathing,”</span> said the evil spirit slowly, <span class="tei tei-q">“ever since you
entered my kingdom. I know who you are and who
protects you. Your presence tortures me; so be brief
with your mission. I will answer you truthfully, for the
experience of ages has taught me that it is useless to resist
that sphere. Be quick and release me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“is one of the magicians of
Egypt, who imitated the miracles of Moses and Aaron.
He is the most cunning and powerful of the species.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Addressing the magician, he continued:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am instructing this novitiate spirit who accompanies
me, in the relation between the spiritual and the natural
worlds. I have told him that all false and evil things are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>breathed into men by wicked spirits: that magic is the
science of evil springing from the perversion of good,
and a means by which you attempt to govern men.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You speak truly,”</span> said the evil spirit, rubbing his
hands with glee; <span class="tei tei-q">“you speak truly. Our power is immense:
our wisdom is incredible. We have vastly more
influence over men than the angels. You have heard of
the witch of Endor who brought Samuel from the dead.
We can reverse that wonderful art. We can bring those
living upon earth into our presence. I will show you
one of my favorite slaves, a fellow of great capacity and
boundless ambition; a genius worthy of the grand inspiration
with which I animate his soul.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thereupon his servant unrolled a great white curtain
against the wall. The spirit went through sundry unintelligible
incantations: and slowly the perfect portrait of
Simon Magus appeared before our eyes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He seems to be in a paroxysm of rage,”</span> said I.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> answered the spirit. <span class="tei tei-q">“He derived it from me
a few moments ago. I was foaming with passion just
before you entered my palace: and now the fury is
expending itself on him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The evil passions of men,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“have
previously passed through the dark and filthy souls of
evil spirits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ha! ha! ha!”</span> laughed the magician. <span class="tei tei-q">“My victim
thinks it is original with himself. Indeed, the deluded
fellow believes he controls me and a vast number of
other spirits. The merest tool in our hands, the dull,
slow machine through which we work our fiery wills, our
stupendous plans; he conceives himself to be possessed of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>miraculous power! Men who think they control spirits,
are always controlled by them. Ha! ha! ha!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Beware,”</span> said my father; <span class="tei tei-q">“are your own inspirations
original? Have you ever heard of Ja-bol-he-moth?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—and seen him,”</span> he answered trembling.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! alas!”</span> he added slowly and painfully. <span class="tei tei-q">“We
govern men from our stand-point: but there are deeper
and more direful hells that govern us. We are slaves
<span class="tei tei-corr">also.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! if Ja-bol-he-moth,”</span> he suddenly exclaimed with
a fierce earnestness, <span class="tei tei-q">“if Ja-bol-he-moth and other great
antediluvian giants could only escape from their imprisonment,
we would soon transform the whole earth
to our liking.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Unhappy spirit!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you find pleasure in
the contemplation of such a thought?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The only pleasure that is left me,”</span> he replied; and
passed into a frigid state with a deadly, stony stare, more
like a statue than a man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“our sphere has paralyzed
him. I have one more strange thing to show you before
we return to the world of spirits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We left the ebony palace; and turning from the dark
river with its colossal reeds and rushes, we passed into a
wilderness of sand, over which hung a gloomier twilight
than any we had before witnessed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Presently there appeared before us a great black dome
of iron, reaching across the horizon from east to west,
and sloping upward from the sand even to the sky. The
blackness, the immensity, the gloom of this strange object
cast a fearful shadow on my soul.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This,”</span> said my father with deep solemnity, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the
tomb of the antediluvian world, which none can open or
shut but Christ. In the terrible abysses underneath are
imprisoned the evil spirits whose judgment is described
in the Scriptures as a flood. Unless the Messiah had
come in the flesh, this antediluvian sphere would have
broken forth and deluged the world of spirits and the
world of men.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What would be the consequence?”</span> said I.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The total suffocation of the spiritual life, as the
natural life is suffocated by drowning; a complete torpor
of the moral sense, a paralysis of the intellectual faculties.
Mankind would relapse into barbarism. The physical
system would degenerate. The skin would become black
and fetid; the hair woolly, the nose flat, the forehead low
and debased. One step more, and from barbarians men
would become beasts.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This process of degeneration had already made sad
havoc with a large portion of the human race, when the
closure of the antediluvian hells and the institution of a
new order of things arrested its march. So the African
now stands torpid, unprogressive, sensual, barbaric, bearing
on his very body the typical shadows of hell.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is there no hope for him?”</span> said I, sadly,—for my
mind reverted to my trusty friends, Ethopus and Anthony.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh yes,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah is good to all,
and his tender mercies are over all his works.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord in the form of a Divine Man will close
these ancient hells and beat back the waves of evil.
Great organic changes will go in the spiritual and natural
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>worlds. In the far-off ages there will be a last judgment
in the world of spirits and a new church upon earth.
New causes will be set in operation; and these Africans
at last will be delivered from their hereditary curse, and
restored to the form of beauty and wisdom which their
ancestors enjoyed in the beginning of the world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I rejoiced at this glorious prophecy. And while
thinking of the tender and noble emotions which seemed
to govern the only Africans I had ever known, we ascended
into the world of spirits, whose beautiful and
peace-giving light I hailed with unspeakable pleasure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How little the inhabitants of earth know,”</span> said I, to
myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“of the spiritual philosophy of history!”</span>

Heaven is above the world of spirits, as the
latter is above the earth. The way to heaven
is through the world of spirits; but it is not
reached by a process of death, but by a process of preparation.
We are prepared for heaven by putting off the
evils and falsities and imperfections that we carry with
us from the natural world. We are then taught to feel,
think and act in unison and love with thousands and
millions of other beings. It takes a long time and a
great deal of instruction in the world of spirits to bring
some people to this degree of social development.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The harmony of souls in heaven is like that of an
immense choir of music. Each has a distinct part, and
each must be perfect in his part. Imagine thousands of
good and pure spirits living in choirs of thought, choirs
of feeling, choirs of acting; and you will begin to have a
faint idea of the order, peace, beauty and felicity of
the social life in heaven.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
New-comers into the world of spirits are always anxious
to be admitted into heaven. There is a process by which
they can be elevated into heavenly societies, and shown
the wonders and glories of the celestial life. This favor
is extended to all, and their legitimate curiosity is gratified.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>They then return into the world of spirits for judgment
and preparation, and to undergo those organic changes
which are necessary to a permanent residence in the
higher spheres.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was delighted to hear my father say that I had been
unconsciously prepared for this wonderful journey. Walking
along with a glad heart, engaged in pleasant conversation
about the difference between the world of spirits and
heaven, I suddenly perceived a beautiful road ascending
a mountain deeply shaded with overhanging trees and
bordered with brilliant flowers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is our way,”</span> said my father. <span class="tei tei-q">“The roads
which lead out of the world of spirits, either up into
heaven or down into hell, are invisible to all but those
who have been prepared to follow them. There is no danger
of any one going astray. No mistakes are made here;
no revelations but to the proper parties. All the art and
cunning of Simon Magus or his master demons could not
enable them to discover this little road leading up into the
heaven where our loved ones reside.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How easy, how buoyant, how charming was that
ascent! No fatigue, no hurry, no impatience, no terrestrial
sensations. Our bodies seemed to grow lighter
and stronger, and our minds clearer and happier as we
ascended. The air grew fresher and sweeter; the trees
and flowers more beautiful; the sky softer and more brilliant.
As we neared the summit we saw the most exquisite
green lawns and terraces, which seemed to have
been dipped in a golden ether. Here and there was a
flock of sheep. Now a swarm of pearl and crimson
but<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>terflies would sport around us; and then a flock of birds
like little flying rainbows would illumine the air.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These things,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“are typical of the
thoughts and affections of the blessed people whose
homes we are approaching.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The vista from the summit exceeded in magnificence
and beauty everything I had ever imagined. There were
two interminable series of green knolls, one on the right
hand and the other on the left, separated by a charming
little valley with the softest, brightest verdure I had ever
seen. On every knoll was a resplendent palace built of
precious stones. The grand rainbow-like illumination
produced by these mineral splendors flashing in the sun,
is altogether indescribable. Away in the east where the
palaces seemed to approach each other, the view was
terminated by a great temple resembling the temple at
Jerusalem, and shining like a gem in the distance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The valley between these palaces was laid out in lawns,
parks and gardens, adorned with flowers, statues, fountains,
lakes, and picturesque walks and arbors. These
things are common enough on earth; but here each of
them exceeded the corresponding earthly form in all the
elements of artistic beauty, as much as the most precious
diamond in the world exceeds the commonest pebble on
the sea-shore.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was the heaven of a society of angels, all belonging
to the tribe of Benjamin, and all interiorly united by
similar thoughts and affections. Now for the first time
I learned that all angels were once men upon our earth
or some other; that the physical universe is the indestructible
basis of the spiritual; and that all things
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>first receive root and form and substance in the former,
to rise and expand indefinitely, in the latter. The earth
is the footstool of the Lord, and is established for ever.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I now noticed that I had on different garments from
those I had worn in the world of spirits, and much more
beautiful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These garments are given you,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“to
adapt you to the sphere which you have entered. We are
clothed here imperceptibly to ourselves, as the trees and
flowers in the natural world are clothed with forms and
colors by a generous nature. All our external things
arise spontaneously around us, without our thought or
care or labor, being perfect correspondences and mirrors
of the things within us.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here is the home of your brother,”</span> said he; and we
stood before a palace of marvelous splendor. Twelve
steps of lustrous pearl led up to a grand piazza covered
with a dazzling arch and supported by twelve columns of
gold. We entered the spacious hall, and before I had
time to observe its beauties, a youthful spirit advanced,
strongly resembling my father; and with a face full of
light and love, and a voice overflowing with kindness,
welcomed me to that little spot, as he called it, of the
Lord’s spiritual kingdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You shall see me as I used to be,”</span> he said <span class="tei tei-q">“and
then you will know me better.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thereupon he underwent the same series of spiritual
changes by which my father revealed himself to me as
the poor old leper of the wilderness. He returned into
the states and forms of his boyhood, as a full-blown rose
might shut, leaf after leaf, contracting itself slowly into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a beautiful bud again. He was the same little Samuel
who sported with my sisters and myself in our garden in
Bethany, and whose withdrawal from us had left so dark
a cloud on the sunny places of our childhood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reassuming his angelic form while I gazed at him with
admiration and joy, he pointed to a chamber, the half-open
door of which was one superb crystal. From it
there issued a beautiful female form, clad in a silk robe
of lustrous white. Her face was radiant with smiles and
beauty, and a single rose was in her hair. The extreme
gentleness and gracefulness of her movements, her manners,
her tones, revealed the pure soul of this bright angel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Behold my wife!”</span> said my brother.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Bewildered and delighted, I pressed timidly a brotherly
kiss upon her cheek, and said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is to me the greatest wonder of all in this realm
of wonders. Married in heaven! Husbands and wives
living together in wedded bliss! Enlighten my darkness;
tell me something of this great and beautiful
mystery.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I perceive,”</span> said my brother, seriously, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the
glance of your eye and the tone of your voice, that you
cannot yet be initiated into the sublime and heavenly
secrets of the spiritual marriage. You have not been
sufficiently divested of your earthly and sensuous state
of thought to penetrate those truths which are only visible
in the light of heaven. Be satisfied for the present to
know that sex and marriage are universal and eternal;
that love is inextinguishable, and becomes purer and
holier the higher it rises; and that conjugal pairs live
together in heaven in eternal youth and eternal bliss.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A most delightful and ennobling thought,”</span> said I;
<span class="tei tei-q">“and I am willing to believe what you say, and to wait
my own spiritual development before being able to comprehend
its meaning.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was then seized with an intense desire to see my
mother. And lo! before I could give it utterance in
words, she appeared before us, an angel as young and
beautiful as my sister-in-law, but grown the female counterpart
of my father by long and loving contemplation
of his virtues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I was attracted hither,”</span> she exclaimed, in charming
trepidation, <span class="tei tei-q">“by strange gushes of maternal feeling.
Who is it that calls me?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mother and child passed simultaneously into the old
forms of the earth-life, and into the long dormant states
of the natural memory. She was a Jewish matron in
Bethany, and I a little boy of five years old. How frantically
she kissed my face and hands! How madly she
pressed me to her heart! How we wept together!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we came back to our last form and state, she exclaimed,
still weeping for joy:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh that I could see you continually in that charming
little shape! I shall make you resume it over and over
again, until I satisfy my hungry heart with the graces of
your boyish form. Ah! nothing is lost. All is given
back to us.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We discoursed on a thousand topics, and floods of spiritual
light were poured upon my benighted, undeveloped
mind. Walking with these angelic friends on the grand
piazza of the palace, and gazing at the architectural grandeur
which surrounded us, I was filled with an exhilaration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of spirits too great for earthly utterance, never to be
comprehended by any one until he meets his friends,
whom he calls dead, in the divine light of the heavenly
world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I new recall these things, poor, old, desolate,
heartbroken man that I am, bearing my earthly burdens
again and doomed to another death, they all seem to
me like a delightful dream! That I walked and talked
with friends in heaven! surveyed their houses! discussed
their laws, their government, their worship, their
occupations, face to face as man with man! Impossible!
Incredible!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What did I say?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was no dream. It was no hallucination. It is possible.
It is credible. It was a fact. My memory does
not betray me. My imagination does not mislead me.
It was all true; and I shall see them, hear them, live with
them again, never to return to earth, so soon as I once
more give up this mortal breath and render this feeble
body back to the dust whence it came.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How long, O Lord! how long?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I learned from my brother that the societies in heaven,
which are innumerable, are arranged according to the
uses they perform, which depend upon the bent of the
inclinations and the expansion of the intellectual faculties
of those who compose them. Men on earth receive their
vitalizing impulses, their attractions to all that is good
and true, from these societies through the medium of good
spirits in the intermediate world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of these societies inspire the love of nature and
art; some the genius and power for civil government;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>some the taste for science and practical life. Some animate
especially the devotional nature; some the social;
some the poetic; and others, again, act as intermediate
powers, balancing and harmonizing the different activities
of the soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The society to which my brother belonged was one
which presided over and secretly vivified the architectural
tastes and genius of man. Near by, upon mountains
whose purple summits I saw in the distance, was a large
society which presided over music. Great societies
which were the secret life and soul of poetry, history,
oratory, statuary, painting and other fine arts, were
grouped around, more or less remote, all holding the
most delightful communications and interchanges with
each other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was astonished to learn that the peace and joy and
highest happiness of the angels spring from the exercise
of their faculties in the performance of useful service to
each other. They are never idle, but continually engaged
in doing something useful from the love of use. I learned
that in this the angels find their chief delight; and that,
although they occasionally meet for formal and social
worship, and unite in prayer and songs of praise as people
do on earth, they nevertheless regard the loving and faithful
performance of the duties of their respective vocations
as the highest kind of worship. This they call <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></span>
worship; and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">formal</span></span> kind in which they sometimes
engage, is merely to fit them for the higher and more
real kind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you ever see your earthly friends,”</span> I asked,
<span class="tei tei-q">“struggling and toiling in the dark abyss of nature,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>before they cast off their earthly covering and rise into
the light and beauty of these higher worlds?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not directly!”</span> replied my brother, <span class="tei tei-q">“for there is
no continuity between spirit and matter. To speak philosophically,
there is continuity and correspondence; but
spirit and matter are not degrees of the same substance,
differing only in tenuity, as is commonly supposed. It is
impossible for us to see or hear anything in the natural
world, except through the medium of some living man
whose interiors have also been opened.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wonderful as it may seem to you, the spirits of men
still living in the flesh are really in the spiritual world,
all the time connected secretly with spiritual societies.
They are invisible to us, however, because their thoughts,
affections and senses all open downward and outward into
nature. They become dimly visible, but do not communicate,
when they are in states of profound abstraction
or great spiritual elevation.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We see them occasionally also by correspondences,
which would appear to you like visions or dreams. In
every society these manifestations are different, depending
on the nature and functions of the society. In ours, for
instance, the mental states of our earthly friends are sometimes
revealed to us architecturally. That is, we see them
as in a dream building houses: and without knowing their
names or earthly whereabouts, we judge of their characters
by the materials, the progress, the execution, even to the
minutest details of the work they seem to be doing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wonderful and beautiful!”</span> I exclaimed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I can show you this wonderful thing more easily than
I can explain it. We have here the power,
incompre<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hensible to you at present, of recalling these symbolic
images and making them appear before us again, as if
they were external and real things.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Look,”</span> he said, and the horizon toward the north
seemed overcast. A thin veil of mist arose before us,
and through it we discovered a dim range of hills, upon
each of which a house was in process of erection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Every man in the flesh,”</span> said my brother, <span class="tei tei-q">“is always
engaged, unconsciously to himself, in building his
future house in the spiritual world; for the entire spiritual
life of a man is represented symbolically by his residence
here and its appointments. All the activities
of your hands, heart and brain in the good and true
things of the earthly state, are so many contributions to
the materials, style, form, color and finish of your eternal
home.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Observe,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“that some of those houses
are nearly finished, others are barely begun. Some of
them are in styles of great grandeur, others are very
plain. The materials, too, and the execution differ immensely.
Observe also that a man alone is at work on
some; a man and a woman on <span class="tei tei-corr">others.</span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why is that?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When a man and woman are truly married, they
assist each other in building the same house; for they will
live together as husband and wife for ever in heaven.
Sometimes persons not married in the world, are seen
working together here. Such persons have strong interior
affinities, unknown it may be to each other on
earth, and will be united in heaven.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Strange and beautiful!”</span> said I.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And true!”</span> he exclaimed, earnestly. <span class="tei tei-q">“The true is
always strange and beautiful.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you will look closely,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will
see many faint and shadowy forms that are earnestly
assisting these men and women in carrying the heavy
materials and putting everything into its proper place.
These are attendant good spirits invisible to the workers
themselves. When a house is finished, we know that the
architect has been released from the bondage of the earth-life,
and will soon occupy the same house vastly beautified
and glorified in some heavenly society.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus are spiritual houses—houses not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens—builded by our prayers, our faith,
our hopes, our loving thoughts, our useful and unselfish
deeds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I see some houses,”</span> I remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“upon which no
one is working. They seem to be falling to decay.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The builders have been led away into temptation by
evil spirits. The work of regeneration appears to be
arrested or retroceding. The Lord will lead them by
ways they know not, and they will renew their labors.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While gazing at this strange scene and scrutinizing
these shadowy architects of future homes, I suddenly
recognized my own figure toiling along under a great
beam which was to constitute one of the door-posts on
the ground-floor. My house was scarcely begun.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“See, brother,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have passed into the spiritual
world and my house is not finished.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I never saw it so before,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“I would say
confidently from this, that your earthly mission is not
ended.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While he was speaking, my attention was arrested by a
woman in a black robe on the side of the hill opposite to
where my own figure was. This woman was bent almost
to the earth under a great block of stone, which she was
bearing to put into the walls. Several shadowy forms
were busy around her assisting in the difficult task.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And that woman?”</span> said I.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is probably your future wife.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An insatiable desire immediately seized me to behold
her face. Forgetting my painful experience in the imaginary
heaven of the Greeks, I thought only of Helena.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is she,”</span> said I, to myself. <span class="tei tei-q">“She is a pagan.
She is surrounded by evil spheres. She is unregenerate.
Her regeneration will be painful and difficult. The good
angels are assisting her. The foundations of our house
are laid; the structure will rise; the joint work of our
secretly united souls. I always knew it and felt it. It
cannot be otherwise!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this ecstasy of thought I watched the bowed figure
in the black robe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh that Helena could see and know that I am with
her and she with me, laying the invisible foundations of
our eternal home! What felicity that would be! Let
me speak to her! Let me see her face!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The intense desire of a strong will is at once granted
in the spiritual world. The woman in the black robe
slowly raised her eyes to heaven and turned her face
toward me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the pale, sorrowing face of Mary Magdalen!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary Magdalen!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The blood all seemed to rush back upon my heart, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>I stood with a chilling, suffocating sense of disappointment
hard to describe. But the loss of Helena, grievous
as it was, was not the only ingredient in my cup. There
was vexation as well as disappointment. A deep sense
of mortification overpowered me at the substitution of
Mary Magdalen, a woman without character or friends,
recently possessed of seven devils—a creature miserable,
outcast, forlorn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secret feelings of social superiority, self-righteousness,
and offended dignity, embodied themselves in my exclamation
of contempt:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mary Magdalen!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I brought upon myself immediately the operation of
one of those spiritual laws which excite so much astonishment
in the new-comer. My angelic friends were
total strangers to earthly passions, to the frenzy of love,
the rage of disappointment, the sentiment of superiority,
the feeling of contempt. Loving all alike with infinite
tenderness and pity, the angels of God do not see any
difference between the self-righteous saint and the audacious
sinner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My outburst of unregenerate passion separated me at
once from my heavenly companions. It appeared to
them that the ground opened and swallowed me up.
They no doubt exclaimed to each other:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Poor fellow! He is not yet prepared to enter upon
the heavenly life. We will wait on the Lord, who
bringeth all things to pass.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sensations were different. The architectural heavens
of the tribe of Benjamin vanished from my sight; all was
dark for a moment; and, remitted into my former state, I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>found myself in the world of spirits just where I had been
raised from the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My faithful friend John the Baptist was near me, and
extended his generous hand.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“You now understand,”</span> said my father, who had
rejoined us, <span class="tei tei-q">“the spiritual law which separates
heaven from hell. Similarity of mental
states produces presence; dissimilarity separates. Societies
are held together by the cohesive power of spiritual
affinity. In heaven they are all in perfect light and perfect
peace, because they all obey the spiritual attractions
of the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven, then,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“is open to all, but none

its inhabitants?”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Precisely so. Whenever a false or sensual idea arises

<span class="tei tei-q">“How then can one be prepared for heaven?”</span> asked I,
sadly; <span class="tei tei-q">“for it seems that I am very, very far from that
state of perfection.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One is prepared for heaven by his life on earth.
The life of a man is the aggregate of his loves. The state
of the heart determines the hereafter. It is the intellect

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>many creeds, many questions. To the heart there is but
one thing needful, one care, one duty—to cast out the
love of self, or duly subordinate it to the love of the Lord
and the neighbor.</span>

and charity unconnected with the hope of reward, deeds
of self-sacrifice, generous emotions, pure affections, the
spirit of forgiveness, reverence for God, obedience to

heart and the powers which build up the heavenly character
in the soul, and the future heavenly world in which
it resides.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My life upon earth is then a poor warrant of a life

no fixed principles. I have no love for spiritual things.
I have a certain taste for the true and beautiful, a certain

<span class="tei tei-q">“As the herald of the Lord, forerunning His work in
the world of spirits as I did in the natural world, I have
become acquainted with an extraordinary fact, which it
is my business here to announce. You are to leave us
and return into your natural body. You disappeared
from your earthly friends and became visible to us; you
will now disappear from us and become visible to them.
Christ will recall you from the dead after your body has
lain four days in the grave. You will be the subject of a
great miracle of the Lord; and your story will animate
the faith and hope and love of the Church in all ages of
the world.”</span>

intelligible from the spiritual stand-point. Attend to my

actively in both worlds at the same time; in his spiritual

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He is performing a series of divine works in both

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This is the world of causes, that is the world of
effects. There is no effect without a cause. It seems to
men in the flesh that the miracles of Jesus are performed
by his word alone—by the breath of his mouth. That
is a mistake. They are the natural effects of spiritual
causes. Jesus is engaged in this world of spirits in
instituting a series of causes which are to produce certain
natural effects; among them, his benevolent works
called miracles.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Miracles are not violations of natural law. They
are only proofs that spiritual or divine forces govern in
all the transformations of matter. They teach men the
true source and origin of causes, and the true relation
between the spiritual and natural worlds. All things are
miracles. They are only wonderful when the events
are new, extraordinary, not understood, or misinterpreted.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Christ could not restore natural sight to a blind
man, unless he excited into activity those spiritual causes
which produce both spiritual and natural sight. Imparting
spiritual light or wisdom to the spiritually blind
in this world, he originates a force which, passing
through his own natural body, restores vision to the correspondingly
blind man on the earth upon whom he lays
his hands.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He here infuses moral vigor into souls who had lost
the power of performing their spiritual duties. This

<span class="tei tei-q">“When he preaches spiritual truth to those who have
never risen above the perception of natural things, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“So of all his miracles, even that of raising the dead.

spiritually dead, he sets in operation a spiritual cause
which imparts life again to those who are dead in the
natural sense.</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such is the spiritual philosophy of miracles, which
men in their ignorance suppose to be contraventions of
natural law, designed to prove the possession of divine
power. God violates no law either spiritual or natural.
He is Law itself. It would be a contravention of the
eternal organic law if miracles did not ensue, after the
institution of their specific causes in the world of spirits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You draw indeed,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“a wonderful and
beautiful parallel between the spiritual and the natural

I understand also, in some measure, your philosophy of
miracles; still I do not perceive how I am to get back
into the natural world.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will make it plain to you presently. When you
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>come within the power of an evil sphere, it endeavors to
absorb your individuality, and to assimilate you entirely to
itself. If you approach the sphere of spiritual pride and
self-righteousness, unless you are under divine protection,
you will become proud and self-righteous. Approach
the sphere of ambition, and you become fired with the
insatiable lust of dominion. Approach the sphere of
sensuality, and your heart, blood, brain, are all set on
fire with hell.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Such is the contagion of evil. Contagion, whether

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now if under certain circumstances you enter the
evil spheres of this world, you will be reduced to the
state of the spiritually blind, deaf, dumb, paralytic or

interiorly and by correspondence with the blind, deaf,
dumb, paralytic or dead, in the natural world. Do you
not see?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Go on,”</span> said I, following with deep interest the chain
of his reasoning.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, you will descend among these people whom
we call the spiritually dead. You will enter into their

without your consciousness.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spirits who possess them. Spiritual life will begin to dawn
on their souls. Both spiritual and natural life will spring
up for you simultaneously.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why for me alone? Why will not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></span> dead bodies

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Because their connection with nature has been long
and totally sundered. On the contrary, you have still a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your spiritual companions will be delivered from
their bondage to hell, and will emerge into the activities

from the bondage of hell and the grave; and will be
raised from the dead and restored to your friends in
Judea.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I contemplated with awe the extraordinary fate that
awaited me. I felt some reluctance at leaving a sphere
so bright and beautiful, where I had been initiated by
such charming friends into high and holy truths. I felt
deeply convinced, however, that I was unprepared for
heaven, and was grateful for a more extended probation
on earth. An encouragement also to resignation was
the thought that I was going back to comfort and protect
my loving and lovely sisters, Martha and Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But these people who are spiritually dead,”</span> said I.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are their corpses here, also, and sepulchres and monumental
inscriptions?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no!”</span> said my father, who took up the conversation;
<span class="tei tei-q">“you are now thinking from your natural stand-point.
The spiritually blind are those who are blind to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spiritual things. The spiritually dead are those who are
dead to spiritual things. They comprise an innumerable
multitude of souls who have lived a merely sensual life,
and who have no knowledge or love of anything higher
or better or purer than the wretched existence they led in
the life of nature.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this conversation we had been advancing toward
the north. We came now to the brow of a great
hill, whence the country sloped suddenly downward and
spread into a vast plain. It had a cheerless and wintry
aspect; for the cities and villages and fields were all covered
with snow. Afar off along the line of the horizon
was a dim blue ocean, full of icebergs of enormous size.
A gray twilight hung over this cold region, the darkness
of which was occasionally illumined by electric flashes in
the sky.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There are spiritual as well as natural zones,”</span> said
my father—<span class="tei tei-q">“zones of thought and affection, in which the
heat and light vary in intensity according to the interior
states of the dwellers. Cold and darkness arise always
in this world from the want of spiritual heat and light,
which are love and wisdom.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here we take our adieu,”</span> he continued, in a tone
which revealed a touch of sadness. <span class="tei tei-q">“That great light
just rising in the east and south indicates the approach
of the Lord with all his hosts of ministering angels and
spirits. His presence will disperse the demons of darkness,
who have so long sat like ghouls upon the hearts
of myriads of feeble and helpless beings.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! how the love and faith of the Church in
heaven have watched over these dead souls! and have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wept and prayed for them, like two lovely sisters weeping
and praying over the body of a dead brother! How have
they longed for this day of the Lord, and how have they
wondered, sorrowing, that He has so long delayed his
coming!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He comes! He who is the resurrection and the life!
and these dry bones shall live; these dead souls from all
pagan lands shall come out of their graves; and the power
of death and hell shall be overthrown!</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Descend, my son, into the grave that leads you back
into life.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My spirit-friends now bade me a tender adieu, pronouncing
benedictions upon me and speaking words of
encouragement. Bewildered and amazed, wondering and
fearing what would happen next, I went down the steep
slope toward the cold and silent plain. As I moved
along, a great change came over my spirit. There was
a perceptible closure of some window from above, through
which the vital currents descend into the soul. This was
followed by a loss of memory, a vanishing of thought, a
sense of fainting or death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The last thing I remember was the music of a sweet
hymn wafted softly from the brow of the hill. The
words were these:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was my father and John the Baptist comforting to the
last the forlorn spirit that was sinking in the waters of
Lethe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of what occurred after I reached the plain, I have not
the slightest recollection, if indeed I ever knew. What
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kind of people I saw, what they were doing, what Christ
and his angels did, what changes followed—all is a perfect
blank to me. I cannot account for this fact. It will
all be made plain to me when I ascend again into the
spiritual world. Certain it is, that a sublime scene of
judgment and deliverance took place, but that it did not
come within the range of my consciousness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first thing I became aware of, was a sense of infinite
pity. I did not know whether I was in the spiritual
or in the natural world. I was flooded with a vast, deep,
boundless spirit of compassion. I wept—I did not know
why. This was the communication to my soul of the
life flowing from the Divine Man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus wept.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was not only weeping for me, as the Jews supposed
who witnessed the external side alone of this wonderful
scene. The loving heart of the Divine Being was touched
with infinite, celestial pity for the innumerable multitude
of the spiritually dead. It was a drop of that infinite
pity which stirred my soul from the sleep of death. It
was a drop of that infinite pity which trickled down the
face of Jesus, as he wept in the garden for the brother of
Martha and Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That communication of the divine grief to me must
have come from the spiritual side of my perceptions. I
passed again into a dreamy, almost unconscious state, from
which I was aroused by a clear sweet voice, saying,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lazarus! come forth!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I started to my feet. Blind, bound, bewildered, I
staggered toward the voice. The fresh air struck sweetly
on me, and I revived.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The voice continued:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Loose him and let him go!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Oh how many myriads of invisible but happy spirits
heard at the same moment similar words of deliverance
and comfort, from the omnipresent God speaking in the
world of spirits as He had spoken on earth!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was freed from the shackles of the grave and looked
around me. I was in the sweet garden of Bethany,
standing by the stone which had been rolled away from
the sepulchre, beneath a bright and beautiful sky. A
crowd of friends, with faces full of wonder and joy,
were grouped around. My sisters had swooned at the
feet of Jesus, who was smiling benignantly upon me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I took in the whole situation at a glance. Remembering
everything; remembering my former unbelief and
indifference; remembering the wonderful scenes I had
witnessed; remembering Jesus in his spiritual body, seen
also by the three disciples on the mount; remembering
his divine character, his warfare with hell, his judgments,
his mercies; and now understanding in part the divine
mystery of the incarnation; I knelt at his feet in the
deepest humility and the most undoubting faith, exclaiming,

I was borne to my bed-chamber by my friends;
for I was not able to walk. The curious crowd
followed us to the gate, but very few persons
were admitted into the house. They judiciously forebore
attempting to converse with me, and I fell immediately
into a refreshing sleep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes—raised from the dead!”</span> said Martha; <span class="tei tei-q">“Praise
be to the Son of God!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Raised from the dead!”</span> echoed Mary with deep
solemnity, her voice faltering with emotion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Trying to recall what had happened, I was struck with
a curious impression which had been left on my mind.
It was the impression that a very long time—months,
years, many years, had elapsed since I died. I had
passed through so many wonderful states, had seen so
many astounding things, and been initiated into so many
spiritual mysteries, that when I came to think of them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from my earthly stand-point, it seemed impossible that so
much experience could have been crowded into a few
days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If this be really Lazarus,”</span> said I aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">“he ought
to be a gray-headed old man, and his sisters wrinkled old
women; for surely many years have passed since he fell
sick in Bethany.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The words disquieted my sisters, who were afraid of
returning delirium. They enjoined upon me absolute
silence on the plea of my great weakness. So I lay
upon my couch, looking alternately out of the two windows
of my room. One of them opened upon the inner
courtyard with its little fountain of water, as beautiful to
my eyes as if it had been a great column of crystal.
From the other I saw the summit of the Mount of Olives,
beyond which lay the Holy City, concealed as heaven is
concealed from us by the intervening heights of our
earthly passions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary sat near me engaged on some fine needlework;
Martha at a little table close by, poring over a beautiful
golden-clasped parchment of the Psalms of David. They
occasionally lifted their eyes with watchful interest to my
face. It was a soothing pleasure to contemplate these
lovely women. There was a soft, pure, heavenly atmosphere
about them, which reminded me of the heaven
I had left; and I understood the words of the Psalmist,
that man was created only a little lower than the angels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Where is Jesus, our benefactor?”</span> I inquired, breaking
through their injunction to keep silence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Gone into Jerusalem,”</span> was the reply.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If our good father was here,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“he would tell
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>us what great change in the world of spirits was coming
next; for every movement of Jesus on earth is significative
of wonderful things going on in the sphere
above us. But alas! from this earthly point of view, all
is darkness!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The startled expression of my sisters’ faces showed
that they thought my mind was wandering. They only
replied by putting their fingers warningly upon their
lips.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So I shut my eyes and addressed myself to sleep again;
but pictures from that museum of Art which memory
builds for us all, came floating before me. Mary standing
silent and downcast at the mouth of the deserted
cave; the Son of the Desert, the zebra of my vision,
wearing in his wild life the ring which Martha had given
him; Ethopus parting with his treasure to rescue his
brother; the haughty stare of the guests of Hortensius in
the Hall of Apollo; Helena, the beautiful, leaning
against the emerald tree and clapping her hands at the
drunken Bacchus; Mary Magdalen toiling up the hill
under the terrible load, and comforted by invisible
spirits; the great snow-fields and ice-mountains of the
spiritually dead, whom I felt but did not see; all these
things and many more passed and repassed before my
mind’s eye, until, lulled as if by the ceaseless patter of
rain, I fell a second time into a deep slumber.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was thoroughly restored when I awoke the next
morning. I immediately repeated the Lord’s Prayer
after my father’s example; and entered, upon the first
page of the book of my new life, a firm resolution to
prepare my soul by faith and obedience for an eternal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>home in the heaven I had visited, but for which I was
yet unfit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As my strength increased I gave audience to my
friends—to very few at first; but recovering day by
day, I soon had the house thrown open to all who
wished to examine for themselves the facts in evidence
of the great miracle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The story had gone far and wide. The death, the
burial, the four days in the grave, and the resurrection,
were all susceptible of positive proof. There were scores
of intelligent and truthful witnesses on every point.
Crowds of people came to see the house, to inspect the
grave, and to converse with me. I was examined and
cross-examined by Scribes and Pharisees, by Jews and
Greeks, by Romans and Egyptians, by infidels and
disciples.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I soon discovered that, although everybody was intensely
interested in the story of my sensations when
dying and when coming to life again, very few appeared
to be long entertained by my wonderful experiences in
the world of spirits. They seemed instinctively to refer
all my statements on that point to the class of dreams
and visions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At first I was astonished and even annoyed at this
indifference and unbelief. But I soon learned that man
at present is so immersed in the life of the senses, that
faith in a spiritual world is more nominal than real; a
faith so vague, shadowy and fanciful, that he will not
accept as true any positive statements about the spiritual
world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Men yearn for the great veil to be lifted; to
communi<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cate with departed friends; to see the patriarchs and
prophets; to learn the mysteries of the heavenly kingdom.
Oh that some one, say they, could return from
the unseen world and tell us all about these things!
With what solemnity would we listen to his words! with
what joy! with what faith!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are the victims of delusion. If their dearest
friends were raised from the dead after a year’s burial,
they would find themselves disappointed. They would
regard them at first with wonder and awe. They would
believe until they began speaking. But when they described
the resurrection which happens to all as it did to
me; when they taught the doctrine of a spiritual body;
the reality and substantiality of the spiritual world; the
civil, social and religious life of heaven; doubt after
doubt would crowd upon their minds, until they would
reject the whole story as a dream or a fabrication.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christ himself declared that the appearance of one
from the dead would convince no man. It is a strange
declaration, but my own case is evidence of its truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The grounds upon which the incredulity of my visitors
was based, were of the most contradictory and sometimes
of the most irrational nature. One disbelieved because I
had not seen Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and because I
declared that no earthly names exist in heaven, and that
respect is there entertained, not for persons, but for character
or quality. Another doubted my report because I
said that David was not king of all the Jews in the spiritual
world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One man, a great patriot, was indignant because I
affirmed that all the Romans did not go to hell.
An<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>other, equally zealous for Judea, was personally abusive
because I declared that more people were saved from the
pagan or gentile nations than from the Jewish Church.
Another was shocked because I said the angels were not
always engaged in singing and praising God. Another, an
ideologist, scouted the idea that there was any form, shape
or substance to the soul, or even in the spiritual world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The most ignorant and conceited of the Scribes and
Pharisees denounced me bitterly as teaching doctrines
utterly at variance with Scripture and subversive of the
interests of vital religion. On the other extreme, our
worthy old Greek gardener laughed at my narrative as a
tissue of hallucinations, because I had not been rowed
over the river Styx by Charon the ferryman, but honestly
declared that I had seen neither Charon nor the
Stygian river.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The majority insisted that I had not been dead at all;
that my condition was only a trance, which had often
occurred before, and had been prolonged to even a
greater period. To this the Pharisees added, that it was
no doubt a trick of magic in which I was guilty of collusion,
and which was designed to extend the fame and
influence of Jesus of Nazareth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some believed in the fact of my resurrection; and the
more enthusiastic went so far as to affirm that my body
had been decomposed in the grave. These were actually
angry with me when I declared that, although I was
so far dead as to be living consciously in another world,
yet my separation from nature was not organic and final,
my natural body being preserved in a peculiar manner for
a reunion with its spiritual form.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I soon became wearied and disgusted with unprofitable
discussions, and with credulities and incredulities equally
absurd. Failing to convince my hearers, or to elevate
their minds into the heavenly light which I myself enjoyed,
I became more and more reserved; and at last I
would not speak on the subject to any one but Mary and
Martha.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These dear women listened with unfailing delight to all
I had to say. The divine intuitions of woman recognize
always a new truth before the calculating reason of man
endorses it. Martha indeed doubted occasionally and
criticised sharply, but was always satisfied after consulting
the Scriptures and comparing what I related with their
sacred teachings. Mary, full of love and trust, believed
unquestioningly every word I said.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the crowd was greatest and the excitement
highest, our old enemy Magistus, assuming the garb
of friendship, came to see me. He had heard of my
death with great pleasure, for he expected to regain possession
of the property and of my sisters. He was at
heart greatly incensed at my return to life, and vowed to
wreak his vengeance on the Divine Man who raised me
from the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He entered with affected friendliness of manner, and
congratulated me on my happy escape from the world
of shadows. He hoped, with sanctimonious earnestness,
that after this solemn warning, I would discard all my
pagan ideas and proclivities, and consecrate my whole
soul to the service of the only true and living God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I told him that I was rather to be pitied than congratulated
on returning to a world so vastly inferior in beauty,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>peace, and joy to the one I had visited. I told him also
that I had been instructed in the true doctrine of God in
the world of spirits, and that I had seen the terrible dangers
which were impending over the Jewish people and
church on account of the blindness and wickedness of
their hearts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will be delighted to hear,”</span> I continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
my guide and instructor was my beloved father, who
passed from the wilderness into heaven, exchanging a
poor leprous body for the radiant form of an angel.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether my looks and tones displeased him, or my
statements aroused his anger; or whether the sphere of
truth, like the revealing light of heaven, compelled him
to show himself in his true colors; Magistus dropped
the mask, scowled upon me with a face full of hateful
passion, and retired, turning at the door to exclaim:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Beware, young man! lest this pretended resurrection
prove the cause of your real death.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had hardly felt myself in full and healthful possession
of my natural body again, when I made inquiries after
that beautiful and fascinating woman, the love of whom,
unrequited and consuming, had been the principal cause
of my death. One might suppose that after my strange
experience with Helena or her attendant demon—an experience
seemingly designed to apprise me of her true
character—she would have been the last person on earth
I desired to see.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Alas! it was not so. The enchantments of the senses
strike deep into the soul. The dream of love first engendered
in the fervid brain of youth is not easily forgotten.
Her beautiful face and bewitching figure were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>constantly before me. And it was with the deepest anguish
that I heard she had fled from her father and
friends, and had gone down into Egypt with Simon
Magus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I found it impossible to turn my thoughts from this
Greek siren whose own evil passions had thus borne her
out of my reach, and to concentrate them upon that other
woman whom Providence had decreed to be my eternal
partner, and who was silently, painfully, unconsciously,
co-operating with me in building that palace in the architectural
heaven of my tribe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary Magdalen followed Jesus as usual, and came
occasionally with the crowd into the front courtyard of
our house. The love of Helena so preoccupied my
thoughts and desires, that I could not make up my mind
to speak to her forlorn rival, or to invite her into the
guest-chamber with the other disciples. So the future
wife of my soul stood without among the unwelcomed
crowd, outcast, solitary, unfriended, patiently bearing the
burden of life for both herself and me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus spent his evenings at our house, until the violent
spirit of the chief Priests and Scribes, on account of
my resurrection, became so apparent, that he withdrew
for a season to Ephraim, where he had several devoted
followers. He passed the time in pleasant conversation
with his disciples, or in reading and expounding to us the
Scriptures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With what eyes and thoughts, different from the others,
did I now regard this Divine Being, seated as a man
among men—among the creatures of his own breath!
My spiritual experiences with regard to Him had cast a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spell of silence and awe upon my soul. I could not
speak to Jesus as before. In his presence I could scarcely
speak at all. Sometimes I found it impossible to lift my
eyes to his face. While the others ate and chatted respectfully
but familiarly with this Divine Man, knowing
Him only as a man, I sat silent and reverential, my heart
humbled in the dust before Him, thinking of the great
golden light which preceded Him in the world of spirits,
and of his divine face shining like a sun upon the angels
of the celestial heaven.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus at length came up from Ephraim and prepared
for that triumphal entry into Jerusalem
which aroused the animosity of the Sanhedrim
to the highest pitch, and gave color to the charge which
they brought against him, that he meditated a political
conspiracy and sought the temporal authority and kingdom
of Judea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many, indeed, of his ignorant followers expected him
to seize the reins of civil government, and to maintain his
position by miraculous power. Then they supposed he
would raise Jerusalem and the Jewish people to the
pinnacle of earthly glory. These boasted openly of
their expectations; and the chief priests and rulers no
doubt congratulated themselves, in their subsequent proceedings,
that they were extinguishing a false religion and
a civil war by the same energetic blow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the eve before this entry into Jerusalem my sisters
gave a supper to Jesus and his disciples. It was a brilliant
and beautiful scene, crowned, however, with a certain
solemnity and sadness; for the great events about to
transpire cast shadows before them which fell upon every
heart. It was there that my sister Mary drew forth, from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a golden box which had been given her by our good
uncle Beltrezzor, a costly Persian ointment and anointed
the feet of Jesus. Judas Iscariot reproved her conduct
as extravagant; and Jesus responded that she was anointing
him for his burial. This prediction of death on the
eve of apparent triumph and glory, bewildered the minds
and saddened the hearts of his hearers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If I had known at that moment, upon what a frightful
precipice I was standing, and what lifelong tribulation
awaited me, I would have been the saddest of them all.
But the skeleton stands invisible at our feasts, and the
serpent coils undiscovered among the flowers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus, with his favorite disciples, Peter, James and
John, lodged at our dwelling; but most of the guests
returned to Jerusalem at a late hour. I accompanied
them through the grove which crowned the Mount of
Olives, and down the western slope, over the spot where
Jesus was afterward betrayed, and from which also he
ascended to heaven. I parted with my friends at the
long arched bridge which crosses the valley and lands
you near the gate of the temple called Beautiful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the last footsteps died away on the bridge, I turned
to go back, when I was startled by the dark figure of a
man advancing from behind a tree. The moon had just
gone down and the wind sighed mournfully through the
olive leaves. This man was Judas Iscariot.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have something,”</span> he said in a low tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“of the
deepest importance to reveal to you. I know your
attachment to our Master. I know your discretion and
your courage. I have discovered a plot against the life
of Jesus. Two hirelings in the pay of the Sanhedrim,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>conscience-stricken, or more probably afraid of the miraculous
power of Jesus, have betrayed a part of the plan.
They are now underneath one of the arches of that
bridge, waiting for me. I wish you to accompany me
into the valley, to question these men, to satisfy yourself
of the nature and extent of the danger, and to aid me
with your counsel and if necessary with your arm.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was deeply agitated at these words. I knew the
animosity of the chief priests to Jesus, and I believed they
would not hesitate to employ the knife of the assassin,
if they could not arrest his career by a public process.
I had no cause to doubt the report of Judas; but for
some inexplicable reason I had a great aversion to the
man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He must have read doubt or suspicion in my manner;
for he immediately exclaimed in a tone of surprise:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why do you hesitate? Is my word not sufficient?
I have chosen you to share in this mission of honor and
danger, because you are indebted to Jesus for your own
life, and because he is at this moment a guest in your
house. Had I communicated this to the brave Peter or
the resolute James—”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Enough!”</span> said I, interrupting him and taking his
arm; and we groped our way along the narrow path
that wound down the steep hill into the valley. Reaching
the level ground, Judas gave a low whistle and four
men started up from behind the pillars of the bridge.
One of them led a mule by the bridle. We approached
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here is your man,”</span> said Judas, suddenly stepping
behind me and seizing me with great strength by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shoulders. The men rushed upon me, and notwithstanding
my desperate struggle they bound me hand and
foot in a few seconds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Vile traitor!”</span> was the only exclamation that passed
my lips before they were tightly closed by a strong
leathern muzzle which was strapped securely over my
head and behind my neck. I was then blindfolded and
put upon the mule. We moved around to one of the city
gates. The passwords were given, for the party were
emissaries of the Sanhedrim. We traversed the streets a
good distance, when we halted and I was conducted into
a house. When released from my bonds I found myself
in a large stone chamber with a small iron door and two
lofty, iron-grated windows.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In prison?”</span> I exclaimed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Judas, who stood in the doorway, rubbed his hands
with insulting glee and said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your uncle Magistus pays me handsomely for this.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If Jesus is ever murdered,”</span> said I, with indignant
scorn, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will be the murderer.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He sneered and went out. I saw him no more. Alas!
I never saw the natural form of Jesus again. He who
betrayed the disciple, was already bargaining for the
thirty pieces of silver at which he estimated the life
of his Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cause of my imprisonment was not doubtful. I had
become obnoxious to the Sanhedrim from the mere fact
of my resurrection. The attention it attracted, the prestige
it conferred on Jesus, the increasing crowd that followed
him, all annoyed and vexed them. I was a living
proof of the power and glory of the new religion, a
stand<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing protest and menace against the old. It was necessary
that I should be put out of the way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was shut out from the world; a pallet of straw for my
bed; a rough table and a stool my only furniture. A
fierce, silent guard brought me a daily supply of water
and coarse food. I saw and heard nothing of the great
sea of human life which was surging outside of my stone
walls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several days and nights passed in this manner. What
had become of my sisters? What had become of Jesus?
If I had been made the first victim, surely these others
would fall shortly beneath the malice and cruelty of such
unscrupulous enemies. These thoughts, attended with
gloomy forebodings, pressed with painful reiteration upon
my mind. I could not eat. I could not sleep. I was
all eye, all ear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was startled one night by a strange uproar in the
street. I was so watchful, so quick of hearing, that I detected
it a great way off. It gradually came nearer and
nearer. It was a riot or street-fight or battle creeping in
the direction of my prison. There were at last plainly
heard shouts, groans, curses, the hurrying of feet, the
clash of arms, and all the exciting accompaniments of a
bloody contest between two enraged factions. From the
triumphant cries and the great flare of torches which came
in at my window, I perceived that one party had driven
the other before it, and now occupied the ground in front
of the building in which I was imprisoned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I put the table against the wall and the stool on the
table. Mounting thus to one of the windows, I could see
partially what was going on in the street.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What a crowd of ruffians of all nations and colors, fantastically
dressed and variously armed!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While I was gazing on this hideous rabble, a man of
huge proportions rode up on a horse finely caparisoned,
which had evidently been the late property of some
dashing Roman officer. This man had a horribly
bruised and swollen face, and an immense, dingy, yellow
beard. I recognized Barabbas the robber.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Break open the doors and release the prisoners!”</span> he
cried in a terrible voice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beams used like battering-rams were soon brought to
bear upon the iron-barred and bolted doors, until the
whole building resounded with the tremendous strokes.
How my heart leaped at the thought of a speedy deliverance!
I determined in the confusion to elude both parties
and escape to Bethany.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At this moment a great outcry arose: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Romans!
The Romans!”</span> and the swift clatter of horses’ feet and
the renewal of all the sounds of a fierce fight, assured me
that the rioters had been attacked by a squadron of Roman
cavalry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly I heard a loud, clear, sweet voice shouting
with wild enthusiasm:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Death to the Romans!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Freedom to Judea!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I recognized the familiar tones before I discovered the
tall figure of the Son of the Desert.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was bare-headed, and his fine bronzed face, his
scimitar and his crimson scarf gleamed in the torchlight
as he rushed bravely forward. Anthony, my old servant,
was at his side, watching his movements with admiration
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and echoing his words. The Son of the Desert was
bringing up a large party of stalwart fellows, armed
with pikes and scimitars, to meet the advancing column
of horse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I called to him loudly, waving my arms eagerly between
the bars. At that moment a strong pressure backward
from the front, held the party stationary for a second.
My old friend looked up at my window surprised, and
smiled his recognition. He kissed his hand to me and
pointed to the ring on his finger which Martha had given
him. Anthony also recognized me, and saluted me
with frantic gestures and every demonstration of childish
joy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The party suddenly surged forward, and the Son of the
Desert raised his battle-cry:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Death to the Romans!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Freedom to Judea!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Just then my guard, who had entered the room, commanded
me to come down from the window, threatening
to transfix me with his javelin if I did not obey. I descended
and seated myself quietly on the stool, listening
in silence to the progress of the fight. Knowing the irresistible
power of the Roman arms, and wondering why
the Son of the Desert had been led into such a hopeless
enterprise, I was grieved, although not disappointed, when
I distinguished by the varying sounds of the conflict, that
the disciplined cavalry of Pilate’s legion were masters of
the field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The torchlight faded away; the tumult ceased. Nothing
was heard but a solitary horseman patrolling the deserted
streets. The enterprise, whatever it was, had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>failed. I was not to be rescued. I was not to rejoin
my sisters. I was to know nothing that was going on in
the busy world around me. I sank upon my straw,
dispirited, despairing. Toward daylight I slept; and I
dreamed of that terrible night by the Dead Sea and of the
words of my uncle Beltrezzor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seems that the riot made my jailers suspect that my
prison was insecure. A few nights after this grand excitement,
I was startled by several men in masks entering
my room. I was bound, muzzled and blindfolded again.
I was placed in some kind of a vehicle. We traversed
the city; we passed the gate; we descended a slope.
The fresh air of the country broke sweetly and soothingly
upon me. We ascended a long hill, as I knew by
the motion to which I was subjected. No one spoke.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At last the vehicle stopped. I was led between two
men into a house. We walked through a very narrow
passage where only two could pass at a time. Suddenly
I was stopped, seized by the arms, and let down into a
kind of vault. Previous to this I was stripped of my
bandages; but it was so dark that I could distinguish
nothing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not deliverance. It was not death, that happiest
deliverance of all! It was a change of prisons—from
dark to darker. My heart sank within me. I
trembled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Strange sounds above me at the point of my entrance
now attracted my attention! I listened with the utmost
tension of ear, endeavoring to conjecture what my jailers
were doing. At last I comprehended it! They were
bringing brick and mortar, and all in the dark! They
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were walling up the space by which I had been lowered
into the vault.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Horrible idea! My former prison was a dungeon;
this was a grave! I was to be buried alive!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The thought overpowered me and I swooned.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I recovered my senses I examined as well
as I could the strange place into which I had
been plunged. It must have been broad daylight
out of doors, for there was a kind of twilight about
me that revealed plainly the contour of my dungeon.
When evening came on I was shrouded in impenetrable
darkness. Such was the only difference between my day
and my night.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chamber was about ten feet square, and its walls
rose to a considerable height. It was evidently an old
secret dungeon partly underground, damp and mouldy,
the scene perhaps of many sufferings and many crimes.
There was an opening into this vault, so that I was not
literally buried alive. The workmen who had sealed up
the space by which I had entered, had left a little square
hole like a window about ten feet above the flooring. I
could see a brick wall beyond it, so that there was evidently
a narrow passage by which some rays of light
came to me. When a door, opening into this passage,
was left open, the light was considerable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If I could have reached that window I could have
escaped; for it was large enough to admit the head and
shoulders of a man, as I soon had occasion to know. I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>made many frantic efforts to do so, but could barely touch
the edge of it with the tips of my fingers. There was not
an object in the room to assist me in reaching it. My
chamber was perfectly bare—not a stool, not a pallet of
straw.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While I was contemplating sadly the frightful fate which
was in store for me, a little lid or trap-door in the ceiling
about a foot square was opened, and a basket was lowered
by a cord. This basket contained a loaf of bread and a
bottle of water. I took out the bread and water; the
basket rose again by the cord, and the lid was closed.
This was the routine, day after day, without variation.
Not even an arm or a hand could be detected when the
lid was raised. Nothing could be seen or heard.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was one thing that varied the monotony, and
only one. Every day, about noon, the door in the
passage was opened, the light admitted, and the ugly
face and head of Magistus were protruded through the
little window. There he stood gazing at me for some
minutes, sometimes for half an hour, on several occasions
for one or two hours. He did not speak. He glared at
me with a stony malignity which is indescribable. When
he had satiated his cruel appetite with a sight of my
sufferings, he retired.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus passed away week after week, month after month.
My sufferings were horrible. I wasted and weakened
day by day both in mind and body. The air of the
dungeon had become foul and sickening. The bread
and water had become tasteless and repulsive. The
silence, the solitude, the darkness, were fearful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus came every day to enjoy with secret
satisfac<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tion the cruel death he was inflicting on me. I regarded
him with such repugnance and scorn, that I did not speak
to him or even look at him. This no doubt inflamed his
hatred. I walked about my narrow prison, whistling or
talking to myself until he went away. My insulting indifference
did not seem to disturb him in the least. He
did nothing to attract my attention. He only looked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now a strange and almost incredible thing occurred.
I do not believe any one can comprehend what
I have to say, unless he has been shut up alone in the
dark for weeks and months; with the mind preying
morbidly on itself for want of external objects to give it
healthful activity; wasted by low diet and a mephitic
atmosphere, by silence whose terror is indescribable, and
by solitude which of itself can drive to madness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I did not look at the stony, cruel face of Magistus;
but the idea that he was looking at me began to take a
singular and painful possession of my mind. I could
not get rid of it. I walked, whistled, talked, sang to
myself, all in vain. The idea that a hideous face was in
the window; that the black, fierce eyes were fixed upon
me; that I could not prevent it; hung over my mind like
the vultures gnawing at the heart of the chained Prometheus.
It became a positive torture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An irresistible desire to look him full in the face seized
me. Whether it was a secret magnetic attraction compelling
me to do so, or whether I thought it might mitigate
my painful and absurd tension of thought on the
subject, I yielded at last. From that moment his triumph
was complete. It was veritably the fascination of the
bird by the serpent. I could not help gazing at him.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He seemed to absorb my whole nervous life, to suck out
the very spirit of my blood, so that I was left breathless,
dizzy, bewildered, helpless, after each of his terrible
visitations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus I lived a daily death for many weeks; ignorant
of all things without; never hearing the sound of a
human voice; buried alive; until hope died in my
bosom, and despair became my bedfellow, and fear my
familiar, and even memory ceased to weave her beautiful
airy tissues, consoling me for the loss of a future by her
glorification of the past.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At first I used to love to review all the incidents of
my life, both on earth and in the world of spirits. I
spent my long and lonesome leisure in organizing my
knowledge, analyzing my experiences, and building up
from them a grand philosophy of mind and matter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I saw plainly that such a philosophy was needed to
give intellectual strength and stability to the young church
of Christ. I knew that no height of piety, no fervor of
faith, no frenzy of love can secure a church from the
cold and critical assaults of the human understanding.
Devotion may be the soul of a church, but Truth is its
body: and no religion without an impregnable basis of
philosophy, can be anything but a transient fervor. It
must inevitably perish by a gradual disintegration. For
this mode of thinking I was indebted to the Athenian
philosophers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The disciples of Christ had no such foundation upon
which to erect the great theological truths they were
going to teach. I saw plainly that such a philosophy
cannot be discovered by the human intellect: and
more<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>over that it can only be revealed to mankind through
some one who has lived consciously for a while in both
worlds. By divine permission and protection I had so
lived. I had been put into possession of truths of the
utmost importance to the infant church and the world.
Surely I could not thus perish in a dungeon! Surely the
Lord who had raised me from the dead, would deliver
me also from this great snare; so that I could delight and
instruct mankind with what I had seen and heard in the
spiritual world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I therefore arranged all my ideas into philosophical
form, and contemplated with intense pleasure the perfect
system of spiritual and natural truth which I had eliminated
from my accumulated materials. It is astonishing
how one spiritual truth leads to another; how all things
are connected together; so that the greatest things are
repeated in the least, and the smallest fragment is an
image of the whole.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With increasing debility and despair I ceased to think
steadily of these grand and beautiful subjects. I spent
much of the time in praying for deliverance, and much
in brooding over the possible fate and sorrows of my
poor sisters. After a while I discovered that my ideas
were strangely confused, especially after those terrible
visits of Magistus, which I began to regard with absolute
horror. I could not distinguish between what had
happened in one world and what in the other; between
dreams and realities; between my hopes and my fears.
The awful suspicion broke upon me that I was losing my
reason, that I was on the verge of madness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then it was that my courage failed and my pride
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>humbled itself; for when Magistus next appeared, I
raised my hands supplicatingly to him and exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, my uncle! why do you thus persecute an innocent
and helpless creature? May God have mercy on
your soul as you shall have mercy on me!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He made no reply, but stared fixedly at me. Not a
muscle of his face moved. No ray of emotion was visible
on his features. He seemed to be as deaf and dumb as a
statue. I might as well have appealed to a tiger or a
crocodile for pity. I was about to repeat my supplication,
but his look appalled me; and I sank, pale, rigid
and stupefied under the old spell of fascination.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was no hope.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let no one suppose that this instance of cruelty is
incredible. Its hereditary germ is concealed in our
hearts. It begins developing in the child when he
tortures the dumb creatures in his power. To delight in
witnessing pain is the basest and most infernal of all our
passions; but it is common enough. Every court, every
camp, every government, and alas! almost every religion
in the world, has its secret records which could unfold
tales of horror worse even than this. Man invested
with irresponsible power, is naturally a tyrant; and the
difference between a tyrant and a devil consists only in
their different degrees of development.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I learned, moreover, in the spiritual world the singular
fact, that men or women addicted to sensual pleasures
unregulated by religious ideas, however kind and gentle
they may seem, have in their hearts a tendency to the
most direful cruelties which rarely come to the surface
in this world, but which rage in hell with unabating fury.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One morning a wonderful thing occurred. How small
a thing may seem wonderful to those who are shut out
from the sweet presences of man and nature!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On taking the bread and water out of the basket, I
found a delicate little rose-bud at the bottom of it. Let
those who see every day a thousand flowers in the golden
palaces of the spring, pity and excuse the frantic pleasure
which this tiny one gave to a poor prisoner, who had
been shut up for months in darkness, surrounded by stone
walls and demons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I seized the sweet messenger of love, for such I construed
it to be; strained my eyes in the twilight to discover
the green and crimson of its livery; and imagined
that its delicate perfume was a little voice whispering to
me of pity and of succor. I wept over it. I kissed it.
I invested it with life. I called it Mercury, Iris, Hebe,
Cupid, Apollo—as a child endows her doll with vitality,
speaks to it, caresses it, nurses it. Perhaps all nature
would be alive to us if our hearts were only childlike.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This flower was a link that reconnected me with the
great world above, so long lost to me. It was a delicate
thread that led me up into the open air under the blue
sky, and out into the green fields and into the gardens
where the winds wrestled playfully with the trees, and all
the flowers ducked their little heads at the great rough
sport of the larger creatures. The beautiful forms and
colors of a luxuriant nature rushed upon me with a ravishing
sweetness. My memory and imagination were stimulated
into rosy life. I wept for joy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The secret of all this happiness was, that the rose-bud
reconnected me with my fellow-men. Some one had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>got hold of the basket who knew my sad story, pitied my
fate, and had sent me a message of comfort. I was confirmed
in this idea when I broke open my loaf of bread;
for I found a slice of meat concealed within it, juicy and
delicious. This was the first variation from my diet of
slow starvation. It was clearly the secret, cautious work
of a friend. Help was coming; my heart danced with
hope.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This little event shed still greater light and blessing
upon me. My mind became clear; my memory acute;
the fear of madness left me. My past sufferings seemed
like a dream. With hope I received new life, new courage.
When Magistus came, I found that I was freed from
the spell of his fascination. I did not look at him. I sat
down immediately underneath his window. I repeated
comforting verses of Scripture to myself until he went
away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That day was spent in the most delicious castle-building.
At night I slept, but was visited by a disagreeable dream.
I thought Magistus had taken my rose-bud from me,
and buried it in the ground; and I awoke with a great
cry, for I suddenly remembered that what we had called
the rose-bud was my sister Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How eagerly I watched the next descent of the basket,
for more comfort, more tokens of love, more hope! It
came; but there was in it only bread and water. My
heart sank within me. I would have called out loudly to
my unseen friend, to know why I was deserted; but I
feared my unseen enemy; for I felt certain that Magistus
always watched the person who let down the basket.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus came as usual; and I sat, not noticing him,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>underneath the window. He seemed annoyed at my indifference.
He shifted his position often and stayed a
great while. He missed the pleasure of contemplating his
work in my ghastly and pallid face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same things occurred the next day and the next.
No more flowers; no more meat; no messages; no
hopes; only bread, water and Magistus. Was it all
a hallucination? Again I began to sicken and despair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One morning the basket came down with only bread in
it. No water! I knew it was a sentence of death. Magistus
was revenging my escape from the fascination of his
evil eye. Before night I began to feel the horrors of
thirst. Awful sensation! I dreamed of water; of the
fountain in my father’s courtyard; of the blue Ægean
near Athens, so soft, so beautiful; of the Salt Sea and
the tent of Barabbas; of the snow-fields and icebergs of
the frozen zone in the world of spirits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All, all depended on the next descent of the little
basket. I watched its coming as a prisoner listens to
the voice of the judge, for life or death. Alas! bread
alone; no water. Torture, madness, death, were now
inevitable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I took out the loaf, which somehow or other seemed
heavier than usual. To my amazement, the basket did not
rise, but was jerked impatiently up and down by the person
holding the cord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What can this mean?”</span> said I to myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I broke the loaf. It was scooped out and contained, in
the cavity thus formed, a piece of parchment and a very
small ink-horn with a pen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I hastily examined the parchment and found on one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>side of it in great sprawling letters, like a child’s writing,
these words:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What shall I do?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A light came into my mind as brilliant as the sun. I
was calm and self-possessed; my good angel recalled to
me the friendly words of Pilate at our parting:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Send for me if you get into trouble.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I wrote as clearly and as rapidly as possible in the dim
twilight:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tell all to Pontius Pilate. Be quick or I die!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I put the parchment into the loaf and pressed its crust
closely together again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I now heard the stern voice of Magistus exclaim to
some one:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What are you dallying about?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The basket ascended. I trembled. I almost fainted.
My entire hope, my life, hung upon a thread—upon
a hair!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How fortunate it was that I did not send up the
parchment alone! My good angel guided me. Magistus
looked into the basket, and seeing it ascend with
the loaf in it, exclaimed,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He is too weak to take out his bread. I will give
him a little wine.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He seemed to walk away and my heart commenced
beating again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At that moment another little flower, another sunbeam,
fell from the ceiling to my feet: and the lid was closed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
High hope in my soul obliterated for a time even the
torture of thirst. I was calm. I was happy. My invisible
friend had received my message. If he delivered
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it, I was safe: for Pilate would certainly release me.
What if Pilate was absent or dead or displaced? Such
thoughts were torture. Still, the new governor, whoever
he was, would befriend me. I determined not to give
way until night.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus came earlier than usual, and threw me down
a goat-skin bottle of wine and water. I thanked him
with the utmost deliberation. He did not speak in reply.
He only wished to fan the embers of life, to prolong my
sufferings. Human nature revolts at the contemplation
of such a demon. Such men are indeed rare, but such
evil spirits are common. They are present to our souls;
cunning, cruel, malignant; infusing their poison into our
thoughts and affections; endeavoring to make us such as
Magistus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The worst evils here are moderated and repressed by
the counteracting pressure of good spheres. To see evil
in its true light, you must see it in the world of spirits and
in hell—evil utterly divorced from good, projecting itself
outwardly in its own brutal forms, and working out its
frightful destiny.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I waited for my deliverance with a sublime hope, a
calm and fixed faith. I knew it was coming. It came.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus had at length reached, as all wicked men do
either in this world or the next, the limit of his power,
the fatal line; after which comes the rebound, the reaction,
the punishment, the disgrace, the sure recoil upon
one’s self of all the evil he meditates against others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Early in the afternoon I became aware that a great
commotion was going on in the house. The door into
the narrow passage was broken open by axes; for
Ma<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gistus always carried the key, and he could not be found.
A Roman centurion soon appeared at the window where
Magistus had so often stood. Oh what a picture was
his brave, handsome, indignant face! Soldiers came in.
The brick and mortar were soon torn away. I was lifted
out and carried into the open air. I was so overcome
with joy that I fainted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The men who beheld my ghastly features and emaciated
form were loud in their curses of Magistus. I was laid
on a bed in the house, and nurses were assigned me.
The kindly centurion did not leave me until I was comfortably
fixed and had recovered from my swoon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Pontius Pilate,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“desired me to present you
his congratulations, and to say that he will visit you to-morrow
when you have been refreshed and strengthened
by food and a night’s rest; and will then hear your story
from your own lips.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I thanked him warmly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And my deliverer?”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“my unseen, faithful

Pontius Pilate fulfilled his promise; and I
told him my whole story from the time of my
resurrection until my happy release by his good
centurion. When I was speaking about the invisible
friend, the flower let down in the basket, and the parchment
with its rude letters, his face grew sad. When I
finished by asking him to inform me how and from
whom he learned my condition, so that I could discover,
reward and love my deliverer as he deserved, he drew a
deep sigh and said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I fear I have done a very hasty and cruel <span class="tei tei-corr">thing!</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The man who informed me of your condition was
the African who accompanied you to Rome, and who
endeavored to rescue the slave from the fish-pond of
Hortensius.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My brave and good Anthony!”</span> I exclaimed eagerly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He eluded my guards; and although wounded by
one of them for his temerity, he rushed into my
presence as I was finishing my morning meal. The words
he spoke were substantially these:</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lazarus, whom you brought from Rome, is confined

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Noble, courageous Anthony!”</span> I exclaimed. <span class="tei tei-q">“He
shall have half of my possessions!”</span> but I was disquieted
by the darkening brow of Pilate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I asked him,”</span> continued the Roman governor, <span class="tei tei-q">“if

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I thought he was a messenger sent by some friend of

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And you threw him into prison?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

to you, his fate would have been different.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The evident remorse of Pilate startled me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And his fate? What was his fate? He is not
dead,”</span> said I, elevating my voice.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He was beheaded immediately.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“O cruel, cruel, cruel fate!”</span> I exclaimed; and
regardless of ceremony, I mourned for my dead friend
with bitter tears and bitter words in the presence of his
august murderer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I feel,”</span> said Pilate, when he bade me a friendly
adieu—<span class="tei tei-q">“I feel that I have discharged a severe duty in
this matter; but the generous conduct of this
African,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>—for he certainly must have known that he endangered
his own life by appearing before me,—would have
entitled him to a full pardon, which I would have
given with pleasure for his own merits as well as for
your sake.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As soon as my Christian friends heard of my reappearance,
they crowded to see me. From them I learned
the sorrows and trials my sisters had undergone, as well
as the strange events which preceded, accompanied and
followed the crucifixion of Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus and Caiaphas had set afloat the story that I
was engaged in the raid upon the city of Jerusalem, made
for the double purpose of robbery and murder, by Barabbas
and his party; many of whom were deluded into the
enterprise under the idea that it was a patriotic rebellion
against the Roman yoke. They also suborned witnesses
to prove that I was killed in the night attack, and was
buried by them with a crowd of other rioters who fell by
the Roman arms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This led to the confiscation of our estates; and as Mary
and Martha were helpless and beautiful young women
without relatives to protect them, they were assigned to
the special guardianship of Magistus. Caiaphas approved
in strong terms this decree of the Sanhedrim, eulogized
Magistus for his generous character and patriarchal virtues,
and congratulated the sisters of a vile robber, themselves
the disciples of a base impostor, on their extraordinary
good fortune in being placed under the enviable protection
of one of the shining lights of Israel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wickedness and duplicity of this high priest will
be almost incredible to future times. But the age was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>evil; the church was corrupt; and public and private
morality reduced to the lowest ebb. The priesthood
was a matter of bargain and sale. The office of
high priest, the holiest and highest in the Jewish theocracy,
was obtained by bribery and fraud and in
more than one instance by murder. Caiaphas was one
of the most consummate hypocrites that ever entered the
holy of holies. He might have changed places with
Barabbas, and justice and religion would not have fared
the worse for it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters, terrified at the thought of falling into the
power of Magistus, their remembrance of whom was anything
but pleasant, fled from our house and concealed
themselves with some of the disciples of Jesus. The two
chief miscreants of the Sanhedrim seemed determined to
get possession of these unhappy and forlorn women; and
they instituted the most rigorous search through the
houses of all persons who were suspected of harboring
them. Their evil passions seemed only half gratified by
my destruction and the seizure of our property. Fearful
would have been the fate of these angelic friends of
Jesus, had they fallen at that time into the hands of his
fiercest enemies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spies and detectives fully authorized to search, arrest,
bribe, intimidate and even kill, were set upon their track
in every direction. The country became so unsafe for
them, that they were conveyed by stealthy night marches
to the hut of some friendly fishermen away down on the
sea of Galilee. Even there they were pursued; and Peter
the apostle rowed them across the sea on a dark and
stormy night, and concealed them in the very tombs
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>whence issued the maniac out of whom Jesus cast a legion
of devils.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After many sufferings and hair-breadth escapes, they
were conveyed out of the country, and at that moment
were living concealed in the city of Antioch, at the
house of a poor but worthy man—himself a Christian,
for Christ had cured him and nine others of the leprosy;
and he alone of the ten had turned back to give
thanks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I wept when I thought of the unhappiness of my poor
sisters; and I felt an urgent desire to regain my shattered
strength and rejoin them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The story of the crucifixion of the Lord struck me with
wonder and awe. I was not surprised that Judas Iscariot
had betrayed him. But the pathetic incidents of his last
supper, his betrayal, his trial, his crucifixion, his resurrection,
his appearance to his disciples, and his ascension,
affected me to tears, and filled me with a spirit of humility,
love and prayer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Those are pictures,”</span> said I, to my friends, <span class="tei tei-q">“which
will be painted on the heart of the Christian Church in
the colors of heaven, and which the powers of death and
hell can never efface.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If such,”</span> thought I to myself—<span class="tei tei-q">“if such is the effect
of this divine history as it appears in the literal form to
man, what must be the power and glory of the spiritual
signification of these great and holy things, when they are
studied by angels in the light of heaven!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Barabbas and his bravest lieutenants, including the Son
of the Desert, had fallen into the hands of the rulers.
Barabbas conveyed to Magistus a threat, that if he were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not released he would expose to the Sanhedrim his
attempt to murder his nephew. Whether Magistus and
Caiaphas, who acted always in concert, feared an exposure
of this kind, which is not probable, considering the
source whence the charge would come, or whether they
followed spontaneously the wicked instincts of their own
souls, they procured the release of Barabbas and the crucifixion
of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mercy extended to Barabbas was not given to his
followers; and two of them were selected to be crucified
with Jesus, to increase the ignominy of his execution.
And so Christ was crucified between two thieves—or
men so reputed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of these was the Son of the Desert.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This brave, wild man, strangely compounded of good
and evil, was heavily ironed and cast into the deepest
dungeon. Magistus had a habit, consistent with his
cruel disposition, of visiting prisoners condemned to
death, and enjoying the terrors with which they contemplated
their approaching fate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Son of the Desert did not gratify his passion for
witnessing the sufferings of abject misery. He was singularly
cheerful and buoyant. He declared himself not
only willing but anxious to die. He had nothing to contemplate
with pleasure when he looked back; and as to
the future, if the soul were really immortal and a second
life were given him, he was determined to start upon it
with new principles and motives.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus was astonished at the calm, philosophic
spirit of this poor wretch, who had never heard of
philosophy.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Magistus was leaving, the Son of the Desert took
a ring from his finger and said:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You are not too proud to do one little favor for a
condemned criminal. Give this ring to Martha, the
sister of Lazarus. Tell her it has accomplished the mission
upon which she sent it. She can touch it without
shame. It has been an angel of light to me. Since I
have worn it, I have seized no man’s goods, I have
taken no man’s life except in lawful battle. If I have
adhered to my band, it was to moderate their passions,
to stay the hand of violence, to plead for mercy, to assist
the captive, and where possible to make restitution. It
found me a slave, it has made me a freeman. It found
me a robber, it has made me a patriot.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was about to say more, but suddenly checking some
rising emotion, he clenched one hand upon his heart, and
waving the other, exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Adieu! adieu!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neither the message nor the ring was delivered to
Martha. The story was told to members of the Sanhedrim,
in whom it awakened no generous sentiment,
but only excited their amusement or mockery. The ring
was taken to Ulema, my poor aunt, who still retained
her wonderful clairvoyant power, which indeed seemed
to increase as her general health declined. Magistus
expected by the ring to obtain knowledge of all the
movements and actions of the formidable band of
Barabbas; for the clairvoyant can see the past as well as
the present, and with the proper clue, can go far back,
on the stream of time, to the very origin of things.
Rumor says that the ring made strange and unexpected
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>revelations, not only about the band of Barabbas, but
about the early history of the Son of the Desert. Ulema
found in the last possessor of the ring her own only and
lost child, who had been stolen from the court-yard by
one of a prowling party of Egyptians, when he was a
very little boy. No discovery was ever made of his
whereabouts, and her grief at the event was one cause of
her after seclusion and ill health.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus was astounded, and perhaps pained, on finding
that his own child had been crucified with Jesus. It
was too late to do aught but bury the whole matter with
the other painful things in his memory. He said nothing
to Ulema on the subject, who was of course unconscious
of it all in her waking state.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A strange thing, however, now took place. The moment
she passed into her trance state, she began to weep
and wail over her lost child. Her clairvoyance put her
in full possession of all the facts of his life and death.
The mother’s heart broke under the immense sorrow.
She pined rapidly, and her white hands were soon folded
in that sweet sleep which precedes the celestial waking.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have a life within our life, like a wheel within a
wheel!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With no knowledge of his parentage, no friend in
whom to confide, no heart to receive and give a last
adieu, the Son of the Desert bore his own cross up
Calvary, and was nailed upon it by the Roman soldiers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He had never seen Jesus before. He had heard of
him only through enemies. He supposed him to be some
fanatic or impostor, or perhaps some political maniac
who aspired to the crown of Judea. At first he joined
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his fellow-sufferer on the other side of Christ in railing
against the king and miracle-worker, whose sceptre and
miraculous powers seemed so useless to himself and
others in his last extremity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the conduct and words of Jesus smote him to the
heart. Through that secret affiliation and sympathy by
which one brave and good man recognizes another in the
hour of sternest trial, the Son of the Desert, educated
only in heart, perceived with the heart that the kingdom
of Christ was a spiritual kingdom. Divining intuitively
the mission of infinite love in which the Lord was engaged,
he confesses his own sin, rebukes and silences his
fellow-sinner, and pleads for remembrance in the hour
of triumph which he sees is approaching for the King of
kings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Brave, repentant soul! Jesus is everywhere; in heaven;
in earth; in hell. And shortly thou wast with
Him and He with thee, in that paradise or garden of the
soul, in which the new life, forgetful of the old, begins
to bud and blossom!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great tragedy was enacted. The disciples at first
stood afar off. But as the death-scenes drew nearer, and
the curiosity of the crowd increased, military discipline
was somewhat relaxed, and the people were permitted to
press closer, and those who had special claims were allowed
to come up and stand very near the dying sufferers.
It was thus that the Apostle John, and Mary the mother
of the Lord, were in speaking distance in his last moments.
It was then that He gave each of them so tenderly
to the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Aside from this awful central scene, which will shine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in all history as the pivotal event of the world, a pathetic
side-scene was enacted, of which there is no historian
but myself; and even I was not present, but relate it at
second-hand. My authority, however, was a man of
truth, John the Apostle, the exile of Patmos.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Far off in the crowd was a solitary being whose eyes
were fixed continually on the Son of the Desert. He
stood with his brawny arms folded spasmodically across
his chest. Great tears ran slowly down his cheeks.
That man was poor and ignorant and ragged and black,
but he had a noble soul. It was Anthony, the Ethiopian,
who, exiled by Pilate into the desert, had there met
Barabbas and his band. He soon attached himself by
a certain instinct to the only noble spirit in the party.
He followed the fortunes of this man; and, true to his
African genius, he imitated his character. The Son of
the Desert was not ashamed of his humble disciple.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anthony escaped death and capture on the terrible
night of the riot. But his master was taken; and the
faithful servant prowled about the suburbs and the prisons,
risking detection and arrest in order to catch a glimpse,
if possible, of him whom his soul loved. It was all in
vain. He followed the vast crowd which went out to the
crucifixion, pushed aside by the spears of the soldiers,
and found himself on Calvary a witness of the last act in
the great drama—an act which disclosed the mighty
power of Love, and foreshadowed and meant the redemption
of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the people were permitted to approach nearer to
the crosses, Anthony came very close to that whereon his
master, the Zebra of the Desert, hung in agony. No one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>noticed the ragged black man. He at last caught the
eye of the poor sufferer, who smiled a sweet recognition.
He was cheered. He felt happy to have one follower,
one soul that loved and pitied him. Poor Anthony wept
as if his heart would break.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He procured a large goat-skin bottle full of water,
and stood at the cross bathing his master’s wounded feet
with the cooling stream. The guards wearied, sickened
with the prolonged sufferings of the victims, did not
prevent him. He listened to the conversation between
Christ and the repentant sinner; and for the first time he
seemed aware that there was another great tragedy going
on besides the one in which he was especially interested.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He sat or squatted upon the ground in front of these
dying men, looking first at one and then at the other;
studying also the faces of the group of holy women, who
with the good John stood near the central cross. A great
idea was dawning on the benighted soul of the Ethiopian,
a great light, a great glory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Why is it that the beams of celestial light pass by the
palace and illumine the hut?—pass by the cultivated and
learned and gladden the hearts of the simple and child-like?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the Divine Man, praying for his enemies, gave
up the ghost; when the great shadows came over the
sun; when the bereaved women raised their wail of sorrow;
when the centurion exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Truly this was the
Son of God;”</span> another convert—humbler, lowlier than
they all—was kneeling at the foot of the cross, praying to
Him who hung upon it: <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, remember me also <a name="corr302" id="corr302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">when</span>
thou comest into thy kingdom.”</span> Anthony assisted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the disciples in taking down the body of Jesus from the
cross. That night, aided by John and two other disciples
who had witnessed his tender devotion to the Son
of the Desert, he took down the body of his master,
wrapped it in a new winding-sheet, and buried it in a
corner of the Potter’s Field.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When washing the body for this lowly burial, they discovered
some beautiful red letters pricked or burned into
the skin immediately over the heart. They were these:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Martha, sister of Lazarus.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anthony followed John to his home and became his
servant. He soon learned the anxieties and conjectures
which prevailed about my sudden disappearance. Remembering
my face at the prison window, he became
convinced that I was still a prisoner. He determined,
with John’s approval, to devote himself to finding and
delivering me. He had no adviser, for John was busy
in saving my sisters from the cruel Magistus, and was at
Ephesus when I was delivered from the dungeon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How well he executed his trust, the reader already
knows. But how he did it; how he discovered my
whereabouts; how he got into Magistus’ employ; how
he obtained the post whence he could aid me; his difficulties,
his hopes, his fears, his emotions—all were buried
with him—alas!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He will tell the whole story to me when I meet him in
heaven, as I most assuredly shall.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poor Anthony! brave to impetuosity, extravagantly
generous, meek to the deepest humility, faithful to the
last degree! In his short, obscure life is concentrated a
glory superior to all Greek or Roman fame.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One more piece of news occasioned me as much surprise
as anything already narrated. This, however, unlike
the rest, was joyful. About a week before my
deliverance, my good uncle Beltrezzor had arrived in
Jerusalem from Persia. He had heard, through his correspondent
in the Holy City, of my supposed death, of
the crucifixion of Jesus, and the mysterious disappearance
of my sisters. He at once suspected some evil, and determined
to hasten to their assistance. He found considerable
difficulty in converting all his property into jewels
and precious stones; and still more in bringing everything
safely through countries which were at war and infested
by prowling bands of deserters and thieves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He had started for Antioch only the day before, having
heard that John had conducted my sisters safely to that
city.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pilate was not slow in bringing Magistus to justice.
Finding that an exposure of his infamously cruel character
was already made, and that the Roman governor himself
had taken part against him, hundreds of people whom
he had injured in person or property came forward to
assist in the prosecution. He was convicted of many
crimes, his estates confiscated; he was exiled the country
and forbidden to return under penalty of death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was ten days before I was able to travel. I chid
the tardy hours that kept me from my beloved sisters and
my dear old uncle, the disciple of Zoroaster.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At last the word came:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Strange things were going on at Antioch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Antioch, the seat of the Roman government
in Syria, was a centre in which met all the
peculiarities and eccentricities of the civilized world. It
was situated on the river Orontes, several miles above
its confluence with the sea. By an extensive system of
artificial works the river was made navigable for the
largest vessels, so that Antioch was in rapport with the
maritime world. It was the city of amalgamations; the
point of contact between the East and the West; the
receptacle of all races and nations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding its wealth, beauty and splendor, the
society of Antioch was inconceivably corrupt and degraded.
All kinds of strange doctrines and unhealthy
superstitions were rampant there. Magicians, sorcerers,
miracle-workers, impostors, buffoons and courtesans were
in high favor with all classes. Life and death were
equally disregarded. Races, games, fêtes, debauches,
combats, processions, seemed to occupy the whole time
of the excitable and licentious populace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus, after spending three or four months in
Egypt with Helena, came to Antioch and began an
extraordinary course of public teachings. It was a rich
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>field for his peculiar genius. He combined philosophy
with sorcery, theology with magic. Of his cruel deeds,
his infernal plots, his insane ambition the world was
ignorant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was greatly changed. The inspiration of evil had
taken demoniac possession of him. He had grown
leaner and darker. His eye, always eloquent and powerful,
was fierce and restless. He had a singular habit of
grasping at his breast, with an expression of suffering on
his face, as if a violent pain shot through his heart. He
had lost much of that calm, self-possessed, imposing exterior
which commanded respect by its apparent strength
and dignity. He was louder in his speech, more rapid in
his gestures, prouder and more defiant in his attitude.
This gained him a larger but more vulgar audience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The magician was on the eve of madness, if not actually
mad.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the age of insanity. It was the age of imposture
and false miracles, of convulsion and persecution, of
moral and physical turpitude, of direful cruelty and
bloodshed, of the wildest fanaticism, of the most revolting
excesses, of actual possession by devils. Nothing like
it was ever seen before or ever will be again, because all
these things were the effects and collateral issues of the
spiritual combat between good and evil, between Christ
and hell; the throes of the great demons of past ages
before their final expulsion from their thrones and the
inauguration of a new spiritual power in the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the state of society at Antioch when Simon
Magus appeared in that city and claimed to be an incarnation
of the Deity, exercising miraculous power. He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seemed to be possessed of boundless wealth. The splendor
of his palace, the rare and gorgeous beauty of his
equipage, his singular and dazzling dress, the wild grandeur
of his manner, the wonderful eloquence of his speech,
and the astounding feats of magic which he certainly did
perform, all created a bewildering impression on the excitable
and unthinking people of the City of Colonnades,
as Antioch was called on account of its architectural
beauty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On his first arrival he had directed his subtle energies
to obtain the ear and the faith of the ruler of the province,
the Roman governor, whose name was Lelius. The
appliances which he brought to bear upon the heart, the
brain, the senses of this weak and vain man, were finally
successful. In a few weeks Lelius was not only the dupe,
but the mere creature of Simon Magus. Helena shared
with her pretended husband the glory and the shame of
this royal conquest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the state of things when the apostle John
arrived at Antioch with the two unhappy fugitives—my
sisters. They were attended by Mary Magdalen in the
humble capacity of servant. This zealous disciple of
Christ had kept modestly aloof from them in their prosperity;
but when thrown together by common sorrows
and persecutions, she tendered her services and proved
through life a most faithful and efficient friend.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John obtained lodgings for the party with Salothel, the
restored leper. Hoping still further to shield them by
drawing the pursuit after himself, he traveled on westward
as far as Ephesus, where he had friends, and where
he began preaching the new gospel of Christ. The sisters
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>remained concealed for a long time, until their fears were
quieted and they began to be intensely anxious to hear
from Judea. They had always doubted the story of
my death, and were continually hoping to get news of
me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Emboldened by their long repose, Mary and Martha
closely veiled took a walk one afternoon with Salothel
through the grand street of colonnades, and sat down to
rest in one of the beautiful public squares. A triumphant
procession in honor of the Roman arms was passing by;
and it was precisely in a great crowd, passing and repassing,
that our recluses thought there was least danger of
being specially observed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly two men stopped near them, and one gazed
earnestly at the sisters. That man was Simon Magus,
thoroughly-disguised. He had received letters from his
old disciple Magistus, telling him how his nieces had
eluded his vigilant pursuit, and requesting him to keep a
lookout for them. Simon also had not forgotten the defeat
of his great scheme at Bethany, and he desired above
all things to get possession of Mary for his own private
ends.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is needless to say that when a man of Simon’s genius
and power gets upon the fresh trail of a poor helpless
woman, it is but a short time before he secures his
prey. Mary, innocent, unsuspecting, loving creature as
she was, the very next day was decoyed from the house
of Salothel by a very old gray-haired, heavenly-faced
man, a devout Christian, who managed to see her alone,
and who wished to conduct her without a moment’s delay
to her suffering brother Lazarus. Of course the devout
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>old Christian was a disguised emissary of Simon; and
Mary found herself immured in a secret chamber of his
palace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What to do with her? was now the question.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus had such intense faith in the incantations
of Ja-bol-he-moth, the old demon of the Lybian desert,
that he was ready to abandon his great theological mission
and convey Mary to the ruins of the ancient city
which was buried in the sand. If he had permitted
Helena to remain in possession of his palace under the
protection of Lelius, that beautiful person would have
approved his enterprise, and would have given him her
blessing with her farewell. But Simon was obstinately
resolved that she should accompany him, and share the
dangers and the glory of the expedition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Helena positively refused to return to Egypt; and as
she was as fierce and implacable as she was beautiful,
Simon was at last obliged to submit to a compromise.
Mary was not to be conveyed into Africa; but she was
to be murdered, her heart extracted, burned into a cinder
and pulverized, to constitute a magical powder of extraordinary
virtues. Thus Simon was to be gratified by an
addition to his necromantic treasures, and Helena was to
enjoy the dissipation of Antioch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And how it will delight our friend Magistus!”</span> said
Helena.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon felt too insecure in his new surroundings to
venture upon the secret murder of the young girl. It
might be difficult to dispose of the body after the heart
was abstracted. The untried creatures and slaves around
him might discover the deed and betray him. His new
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>claim to divinity would be sadly compromised by his
sudden exposure as an assassin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon and Helena devised a cunning plan by which
they could attain their ends without the least danger to
themselves. Simon represented to Lelius that a strange
and dangerous conspiracy against government and religion
was taking root in Antioch. He described Jesus
as a subtle impostor, who, under the cloak of extraordinary
sanctity, meditated the grandest political revolutions.
He painted the disciples in the blackest colors as
the secret enemies of peace and order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The leader,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“of these turbulent spirits was
crucified by Pontius Pilate, whose probity and leniency
are known to the whole world. His followers, driven
from Jerusalem, have spread as firebrands in different
countries; and secretly associated together, they are now
plotting against the stability of all existing civil and
religious institutions.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He claimed to have discovered their plots by magical
power; and he solemnly assured his credulous listener
that he had not exaggerated their importance or danger.
He predicted that in a few years a decree of extermination
would be issued by all civilized powers against these
people, and he begged Lelius to initiate those measures
of destruction which would entitle him to the gratitude
of mankind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I know,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“that one of the most cunning
of all these emissaries is now in the city: a woman,
beautiful, accomplished, designing; concealing under the
garb of modesty and humility, the spirit of universal
anarchy. She anointed this Jesus as king in the presence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of his chosen officers and lieutenants on the night before
his grand entry into Jerusalem, when the mad populace
shouted his claims to the throne of Judea. To satisfy
your mind of the true nature of this formidable doctrine
growing up around us, let me bring this woman before
you and question her in your presence.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lelius assented to this proposition, and Mary was led
or rather dragged into the august presence of the Roman
governor. Simon Magus proceeded to question her in
the most adroit manner, drawing from her exactly such
answers as were best calculated to shock and disgust the
ignorant and arrogant pagan who held in his single hand
the power of life and death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary, terrified and unsuspecting, answered all his
queries in a simple and truthful manner. She was thus
made to say, that she had known and loved Jesus of
Nazareth; that she had anointed him on the eve of his
royal entry into Jerusalem; that she believed his teachings;
that he had risen from the dead and ascended into
heaven; that she prayed to him as God; that he was
coming again to restore Israel and to judge the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This seemed like the wildest folly and fanaticism to the
proud Roman; and he smiled at the thought that there
were people with the semblance of rationality who could
credit such absurdities. But Simon’s work was only half
done. Questioning and cross-questioning his artless victim,
he drew from her facts of a far more serious and practical
bearing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary believed, and candidly acknowledged it, that all
the religions sanctioned by the laws of the Roman empire,
were false religions; that their gods were no gods at all,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or demons; that their boasted oracles were evil spirits;
that the tendency of these religions was only evil, and
that their devotees were living in sin and doomed to hell.
Moreover, that the religion of Christ was to supersede
them all; that no compromise could be permitted; that
it was a life-and-death struggle between the old religion
and the new gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition she was made to say—never dreaming to
what conclusions her admissions were leading her pagan
judge—that Jesus had set apart a great many persons,
twelve at one time and seventy at another, to go forth
into the world and preach this gospel; that he had given
them miraculous power wherewith to achieve their ends;
that angels delivered them from prisons; that they could
strike their enemies blind or dumb or powerless; that
they could raise the dead; that they had a secret organization
with signs and symbols; that they had started or
were going to start on their grand mission which was to
overturn the powers of pagan darkness and prepare the
minds of men for the universal reign of Christ at his
second coming.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Mary was removed by the guards, Simon had
no difficulty in convincing Lelius that his own allegations
had been well founded. Torturing the meaning of
Mary’s words and giving them a purely literal construction,
he inflamed the indignation and zeal of Lelius
to such a pitch, that he despatched private letters to the
governors of the neighboring provinces, informing them
of the existence, motives and plans of this new and desperate
conspiracy against all that was stable, glorious and
venerable in the civilizations of Greece and Rome.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next thing was to determine what should be done
to extinguish a heresy which meant revolution, in his own
province. To this conference Helena was admitted; for
Aspasia had less influence over Pericles than Helena over
Lelius. The Roman governor was weak-minded, easily
led, and without moral sensibility. He was passionately
fond of new sensations, extraordinary excitements, and
the bloody sports of the amphitheatre. He was soon induced
to sanction a magnificent scheme concocted by
that subtle brain which received its inspiration from the
old magician of Pharaoh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our good uncle Beltrezzor arrived at Antioch the day
after Mary’s disappearance. He found the household
of Salothel in the profoundest consternation and distress.
He was welcomed with frantic joy, and joined them in
the most painful and laborious search for his lost niece.
Day after day these sad, anxious souls traversed the city,
walking, looking, inquiring everywhere. Among half a
million or more of people the lost are not easily found,
especially if cunning and unscrupulous power gets them
in its clutches and conceals them from view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the course of his inquiries, Beltrezzor discovered
that Simon Magus lived in the city in great grandeur and
authority. A fearful suspicion entered his mind; for he
remembered the night-scene in Bethany, and the foiled
abduction. He did not communicate his fears to Martha
or the rest, but insisted upon their remaining in the
utmost seclusion, while he conducted the search alone.
He said he had discovered something important, but
which demanded great caution and secresy; and he
endeavored to inspire a hope which he did not feel.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The next day, passing a crowd in one of the squares, he
observed the herald of Lelius reading a proclamation to
the people, which excited the greatest enthusiasm. He
came near and listened to its second reading.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It announced officially, with great pomp of words, that
the government, determined to protect the safety and
morals of the people, had taken measures to extirpate a
certain secret association of conspirators, which had been
founded in Judea by one Jesus Christ, whom Pontius
Pilate had crucified as an impostor and revolutionist.
That the first step in this righteous undertaking, would be
the public execution of a young woman, who was an agent
and emissary of these outlaws, and who had anointed the
said Jesus king of the Jews, according to the old Jewish
custom of installing into the royal office. That in order
to strike terror into these evil-doers, and to warn them of
the fate which awaited them if they attempted to teach the
doctrines of Jesus, the young woman, Mary of Bethany,
high-priestess of this new and dangerous religion, would
be thrown to an immense Næmean lion just arrived from
Africa, in the grand amphitheatre on the afternoon of a
certain day which would be the second Sabbath following,
according to the Jewish calendar. That, to illustrate the
clemency of the government, a full pardon would be given
to the said Mary if she publicly recanted her heresies and
revealed the names of the other conspirators.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor stood aghast at this terrible document, full
of false affirmations. The old man’s heart was pierced
with grief and terror in contemplating the frightful toils
into which his innocent and beautiful niece had fallen.
To conceal the awful fact from Martha was his first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thought—and then he was prepared for any labor, for
any sacrifice to rescue Mary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole city was in a blaze of excitement over this
new sensation. It was the great topic of conversation
everywhere.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And her crime? Oh! said the people, it is <a name="corr315" id="corr315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">terrible!</span>
A female atheist! denying all the gods, and worshiping a
Jew who was crucified between two thieves!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All agreed that she deserved her fate; and that it
would be the most entertaining sight of the season, and
a death-blow to the conspiracy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And see!”</span> said they, <span class="tei tei-q">“the noble mercy of Lelius!
If she recants at any time before the opening of the
amphitheatre, she will be released.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then they all agreed that it would be very cowardly
and disgusting in her to recant. They admired an
unbending and not a repentant sinner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor was a plain, childlike man, having no ingenuity
for indirect attacks, or for unraveling difficult
questions. Thoroughly truthful and honest, he always
went to work in an open, straightforward way. He felt
that, in the great work before him, he had but one hope,
one resource—his immense wealth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If he had loved money more than he did, his hope
would have been greater; for he would have believed
that all men could be bought with a bribe. Unpurchasable
himself, he doubted the power of money. Still he
was compelled to test its efficacy, for it was plainly his
only resource.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He studied the situation thoroughly, deliberately. He
became convinced that the whole thing was the conjoint
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>work of Simon Magus and the Roman governor. He was
sure that Simon Magus, a fanatic almost to lunacy, could
not be deterred or withheld from a favorite project by
pecuniary considerations. The government could not
withdraw its proclamation without a sacrifice of dignity;
and if Lelius were approached on the subject, he would
probably refer it to Simon, by whom all proposals would
be rejected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He thought it best to keep away from these high dignitaries
altogether, and to sound the subordinates. He
was afraid, moreover, that if Simon learned of a wealthy
element working in Mary’s behalf, he would increase his
vigilance and double his guards, so that bribery and
escape would be alike impossible. It was best to let him
believe that Mary was alone, helpless and friendless.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He visited the <a name="corr316" id="corr316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">amphitheatre</span> and sought out the keeper
of the prison connected with that immense establishment.
The keeper had already been questioned out of his
patience by crowds of people to whom he gave surly and
unsatisfactory answers. He was a Gaul by birth, a
Roman soldier by captivity and necessity, Euphorbus by
name. He was taciturn and apparently ill-natured.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor went straight to the point. He asked him
no questions. He said softly:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A word to you in a private room may be valuable.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Euphorbus looked fixedly at him a moment, and led
the way to a small office within. Beltrezzor produced a
sparkling gem of considerable value.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I wish to speak with the young woman who is confined
in the amphitheatre.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Impossible!”</span> said the keeper, gruffly.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am her uncle.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No admittance to anyone on pain of death,”</span> said
the Gaul, casting a wistful eye on the jewel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor drew forth a precious stone of remarkable
size and immense value.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These are yours, my friend, for a single brief interview
with my niece.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Hark you!”</span> said Euphorbus, taking the jewels
into his hand. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am willing to gratify and befriend
you; but there are four Roman soldiers at the door
of her cell, who permit no one but myself to go in or
out.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Are they not under your command?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No. They belong to Simon Magus, and obey only
his word.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lead me to them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man made a touching appeal to these rough
men for permission to see his niece. Some large gold
coins that he offered them had more influence than his
eloquence. The assurance of the keeper that he would
shield them as far as possible, decided the matter; and
Beltrezzor was admitted into Mary’s dungeon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The meeting between uncle and niece was affecting
in the extreme. Mary had greatly changed since her
imprisonment. A deadly pallor pervaded her beautiful
countenance, and she had the air of one whose delicate
nerves had almost given way under prolonged terrors.
The old man clasped her in his arms, and the bitter
tears fell from his face upon her golden hair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh uncle!”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“is it not horrible to contemplate?
A young girl stripped and thrown to a lion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>before thousands of people! Are they not devils in
human form who can witness such things?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She trembled; her eyeballs started with horror; the
cold drops stood on her forehead; she clung frantically
to her uncle.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! I have thought of it,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“until I shall
go mad! And then to hear the lion roaring at night!
It is fearful. He is kept very, very near me. Is not
that cruel, cruel? I hear every sound he makes. I hear
him growling and crunching when they feed him. I
hear him yawning and whining as he impatiently paces
his cage. Then at night he roars as if he thought he was
in the pathless forest. Oh it freezes me! I cannot eat.
I cannot sleep. I shall die!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The head of the young woman fell upon the old man’s
breast.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Have you never thought, my child,”</span> he said, tremulously,
<span class="tei tei-q">“of saving your life by renouncing your religion?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, uncle! never! never!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That’s a brave girl!”</span> said he, tenderly kissing her
forehead; <span class="tei tei-q">“and you shall be saved without it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am not afraid of death, uncle, but of the lion. But
I doubt not—oh! I doubt not that Jesus will support me
even in that last extremity. I cannot, however, control
my fears.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man cheered her with many tender words
and promises of help and assurances of speedy rescue.
Promising to visit her twice every day, he departed to
mature some plan for her deliverance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That evening he was plunged in a deep and painful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>reverie. Neither Martha nor Mary Magdalen could engage
him in conversation. He sat with head between his
hands. He retired early.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the night Martha heard groans issuing from his
chamber. She lit her lamp and entered softly. Beltrezzor,
pale and haggard, lay upon his back with his face
upturned to heaven. He had been weeping in his sleep.
His lips were moving as if in prayer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Faithful, loving old man!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When my uncle came out to his morning meal,
a strange transformation had taken place. He
was buoyant and cheerful; his face was radiant
with a pleasing vivacity. Indeed he was absolutely
mirthful. Martha regarded him with profound astonishment,
which gave way to fear that the dear old man had
lost his reason, when he burst out into the following
speech:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Rejoice, my friends! rejoice, my children! I have
got it fixed. I see our way clearly out of all our troubles.
Get ready, as quickly but as quietly as you can, to leave
this horrible place. Be silent as the grave. A ship will
be ready for us on Sunday afternoon; and while these
mad people are yelling in their vile amphitheatre, she
will weigh anchor, slip her cable, and with Mary on
board and angels smiling on the voyage, her prow will
point steadily for the land of Gaul.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this speech he was rubbing his hands with
glee; and at the conclusion of it he waved them over his
head in an excited manner. His listeners showed by their
silence and the tears in their eyes what they thought of
this singular conduct.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come, come!”</span> said the old man, resuming his usual
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gravity, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am in earnest. God has revealed what I
must do, in a dream. I know exactly where Mary is.
She is well and will soon be happy. You must obey
me. Ask me no questions. Trust in me implicitly. All
will be right.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seeing Beltrezzor so thoroughly in earnest, the little
group became hopeful and cheerful, and proceeded with
alacrity to make preparations for the sudden and strange
journey. Beltrezzor went out into the city, and was incessantly
occupied in arranging and working for his
remarkable enterprise. He barely came home to sleep
at night, so much had he to do in so little time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He continued as vivacious as ever. His spirits, his
hope, his assurance, seemed to rise every hour. At
last, the evening before the Sabbath, the little party with
their baggage were quietly transferred after nightfall
from the house of Salothel to a beautiful new ship anchored
away up at the very end of the long pier which
adorns the river front of Antioch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When they were all safe on board the vessel, Beltrezzor
took Martha into the cabin, and opening a closet, he
showed her several boxes of rosewood bound with brass
bands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“is full of golden coins of various
sizes and value. This contains jewels of incalculable
splendor wrought by the greatest artificers in the East.
This conceals precious stones of great beauty and high
price. And this last contains some genuine diamonds,
brought from the remotest India, and which would excite
the envy of kings and queens.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here are the keys to them all. Take <span class="tei tei-corr">them.</span>”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And all this immense wealth,”</span> said Martha in
amazement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One half of it is for you and Mary.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And the other half?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Is for the man who brings Mary to this vessel to-morrow
and conducts it to Gaul.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, generous uncle; and for yourself?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Something far more valuable than all that.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My uncle returned to the house of Salothel to sleep,
fearing lest its sudden evacuation should excite the suspicion
of the neighbors. Several servants also, bribed to
profound secrecy, were to remain until after the Sabbath.
Beltrezzor was obliged to move with great caution. A
single false step might ruin everything. If the parties
who were plotting the destruction of Mary obtained the
least clue to his movements, his whole scheme might be
thwarted. Mary would be given to the lion, the rest
seized and perhaps murdered, and his splendid estate
confiscated. He could not sleep a moment under the
weight of such tremendous responsibilities.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the next morning, the day of the Jewish Sabbath,
when the grand exhibition was to take place at the
amphitheatre, that I arrived at Antioch. Just as my
uncle was leaving the house for ever, he met me at the
door. I thought he would have started from me as from
a ghost. But he was one of those quiet men whom nothing
ever surprised. He gave me a sedate but cordial
welcome, just as if he had been expecting me. He had
difficulty in calming my excitement and fury when I
learned what a shocking fate was impending over my
youngest and most beautiful sister.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He would not tell me anything about the means he had
adopted for Mary’s deliverance. I was very restive under
this burden of secrecy and mystery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be quiet, my son,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“or you will mar all. You
have come into the fight too late to understand the exact
state of the parties and to take command. Be patient.
Do the part I give you. Do it well, and trust to me for
the rest. We must not be seen together, for you may
be watched, and that might betray me. You must not
go to the ship until the hour of starting, for you might
be followed there, and that might ruin us both.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Stay in the house until nearly four o’clock. At four
o’clock precisely be at the north-east angle of the amphitheatre
on the opposite side of the street. You will see a
chariot standing there with the letter G in gilt upon its
side. A servant will be holding a gray horse a few paces
off. At four, precisely, two persons will come out of one
of the rear doors of the amphitheatre. They will enter
the chariot and drive away rapidly. Mount the horse and
follow them. Ten minutes afterward you will be in the
arms of your sisters!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was very much dissatisfied with this arrangement. I
felt that the stake was too immense and sacred for the
whole work to be left to the knowledge, the discretion
and the energy of one man. But my uncle was resolute
in keeping his plan for Mary’s deliverance entirely to himself.
He bade me adieu. There was a singular tenderness
in his words:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Good-bye, Lazarus. I need not conceal from you
the fact that there is danger in this enterprise. You may
never see me again. You will take care of your sisters in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>my place. Be honest, be faithful, be good. If my plan
succeeds, this will be the greatest, happiest day of my life.
Courage! Adieu.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old sweet smile irradiated his face, and he went
off as gayly as if he were going to a feast instead of entering
upon a dangerous enterprise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I went up stairs in the now deserted house of Salothel,
and sat down at an open window, looking out on a beautiful
public square. At any other time I would have been
delighted with the scene. My heart would have been
cheered by the tender green of the soft grass, by the
rustling of the leaves in the wind, and the twittering of
the birds among the branches. I would have admired
the splendid domes and spires of Antioch rising all
around above the tree-tops, and the brilliant tints of an
eastern sky flecked with fantastic and fleecy clouds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the glories of nature and art were alike powerless
on a spirit sunk into the deepest abyss of sorrow and fear.
My heart was full of the direst forebodings. The morning
hours passed gloomily away. My restlessness became
insupportable. It must have been about noon, when,
looking down into the public square, I saw a young
man seated upon one of the iron benches, whose face
immediately riveted my attention. It was my old
friend and fellow-student, Demetrius, the brother of
Helena.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A powerful temptation immediately assailed me. It
was to do something for my poor sister independently of
Beltrezzor’s schemes, so that if one failed the other might
succeed. One resource only seemed so little to depend
upon. I was nearly frantic waiting thus in idleness for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the fruition of an unknown plan which might fail at the
very moment when its success was expected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I said to myself:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I will speak to Demetrius. He has a good heart and
a clear brain. He may suggest something which may
lead to good. He may enlist Helena in our behalf, if
Helena is here. I cannot see what harm can come of it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I went down into the square. Demetrius was overjoyed
to see me. He did not, however, seem surprised to find
me in Antioch. We sat down together and I told him all
our troubles. I unbosomed my whole grief to him like
a brother. I had the discretion to say nothing of Beltrezzor,
resolving to let the old man work out his own
plan alone. If harm came to any one, it could only be
to myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Demetrius knew that the condemned woman was my
sister, and professed the deepest interest and sympathy in
her case. I pleaded the youth, and the innocent and
sweet character of Mary, against the charge of foul and
dangerous heresy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He seemed to think the heresy was bad enough, for he
indulged in the most contemptuous expressions against
Jesus and his disciples. <span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is all the
work of Lelius. No one can aid you so efficiently as
Simon Magus. Great magician and sorcerer as he has
been and is still, he is a noble and generous man. I am
confident he will assist you in delivering your sister from
her fearful peril. He is now lecturing to a select audience
on the great points of his new philosophy. Come
with me to his palace and hear him. When he has
finished, we will consult together as to what is to be done.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I followed him; and ascending the marble steps of a
princely mansion, and passing through a great hall
adorned with statues and immense vases of flowers, we
were ushered into a room of moderate size, but superbly
furnished. The audience nearly filled the place, for there
were but two or three chairs near the door.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus, on a raised platform, was in the very
heat and height of an eloquent discourse. His subject
was the nature of the soul and its transformations. His
voice was winning, his gestures expressive, his eye a blaze
of intellectual fire. His language was full of Orientalisms
and Egyptian mysticisms. Taught in the severer school
of Grecian philosophy, and blessed with the far greater
analytic light of spiritual knowledge, I perceived at once
that the influx of ideas into his mind came from cunning,
subtle, evil spirits, and that the tendency of his words
was to bewilder, dazzle and betray.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You saw me,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“turn water into wine just
now. You saw me turn silver into gold. You saw me
resolve a rose into nothing; you saw me restore it as it
was before. These things, I told you, were symbolic of
spiritual transformations.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When the spirit by prayer, by faith, by watching,
by study, by abstinence, by suffering—is purified and
etherealized, it undergoes similar transformations, and
from water becomes wine; from silver becomes gold;
from human becomes divine. Thus it is that I have
become the power of God—the Son of God—the Word
of God; and that I have still a holier name, incommunicable
to you.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In this state I have supreme control over matter.
You saw me a little while ago take up a deadly serpent.
It bit a dog before your eyes and the creature died in a
minute. It fastened itself upon my hands and my
cheeks; I was unhurt. You saw me swallow balls of
fire. I am unharmed. So I can float in the air like a
bird; I can live under water like a fish. I can point my
finger at a tree, and it will wither. I can call to a cloud,
and it comes to me. I can curse a city, and it will sink
into the sea.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was an excited and admiring murmur among
his credulous hearers. The fanatical impostor continued:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“These powers are awful and incomprehensible to
you who do not possess them. They are only given to
the wise who use them wisely. But I have attained to a
height of glory, in comparison with which these first
labors and results are insignificant. Having become the
emanation of God, I can create souls out of nothing. I
can restore souls to life which had been given to annihilation.
I will show you a soul I have created.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a great murmur of astonishment and applause.
The curtains were now drawn and the room
darkened. The wall behind Simon appeared to open,
and the most beautiful sight was presented to view that
I have ever witnessed. The chamber beyond was one
resplendent glory of golden light. It did not seem to
be lighted, but to be filled with light as a golden vapor.
In the midst of the room, half-way between the floor and
ceiling, both of which seemed to be mirrors of shining
brass, hung or floated a rosy cloud, shaped like a throne,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>over which was a canopy of celestial azure. On that
throne was seated Helena, my first and only love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I turned to look Demetrius in the face at this splendid
creation (?) of his gifted brother-in-law. Demetrius had
left the room unobserved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Simon,”</span> said I to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“has lost his old sublime
faith in his diabolical art, and has resorted to magical
impostures.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I turned my attention to Helena. Now I solemnly
avow that the woman, her chair and all, whatever they
may have been, were ten feet in the air, entirely unsupported
by anything visible to mortal eye. Whether this
was some magical trick, really explicable by natural law,
or effected by the assistance of evil spirits, I do not
know. Of this, however, I am certain, from experience
and knowledge acquired in the spiritual world, that evil
spirits can, under certain conditions, lift the heaviest
articles high in the air and keep them there for a considerable
time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“This,”</span> said Simon Magus, enjoying the ineffable
amazement of his hearers—<span class="tei tei-q">“this is the soul of Helen of
Sparta, who caused the Trojan war. She was annihilated
for her extreme wickedness. I have recalled her to life;
and, wonderful to relate, I have purified and spiritualized
her whole nature by the sanctifying influence of my
presence.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I gazed upon this strange scene with intense interest,
and was soon enchanted with the face of Helena. Never
in this world have I seen features of such exquisite beauty;
and neither in this world nor in the other have I seen a
face expressive of such womanly love, tenderness,
sweet<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ness and purity. The white peace of heaven was enthroned
upon her brow, and the softness of infinite pity beamed
in her eyes. If she was a picture, it was a subject
for boundless enthusiasm. If she was living, she was
an object for profound adoration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So thought every one who looked on. It is strange
that I did not remember what I had been taught in the
world of spirits, that syrens and wicked women there can
counterfeit angelic forms so cunningly as to deceive the
angels themselves for a while.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There,”</span> said I, to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“is a gentleness, a holiness,
a purity, a mercy which I know will save my sister
from the lion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The curtain or wall or whatever it was, was closed, and
Simon went on with his lecture. I did not hear a word
of it, so rapt was I in the contemplation of Helena’s
seraphic face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, if I could speak to that vision of superlative
beauty, I am sure she would befriend my poor
sister.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Suddenly Demetrius touched me on the shoulder and
whispered:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“My sister wishes to see you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I followed him, asking no questions, bewildered, unthinking,
but whispering to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“Helena wishes to
see me!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We passed through the superb hall, and opening a
door near the end of it, Demetrius ushered me into the
room without entering himself. Helena advanced to
meet me. I was delighted with the extraordinary warmth
of her reception. If we had been passionate lovers long
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>separated, she could not have manifested more pleasure at
seeing me!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Superbly beautiful as she was, that heavenly radiance
and purity which I had seen upon her countenance a
few moments before, had vanished. There was nothing
spiritual in her expression. She was plainly no spirit and
no soul just created, but a perfectly formed, glowing, enchanting
woman of flesh and blood. I was about questioning
her on the subject of her extraordinary deception,
when she spoke:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I knew you wanted to see me. I sent Demetrius
out to look for you. You are in trouble, and I long to
assist you. Sit down with me on these cushions and tell
me all your story.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She touched a little bell, and a tall, stately servant
appeared at the door.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wine and refreshments,”</span> said Helena.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We sat down together, and I told her all about poor
Mary, still wisely omitting the part of Beltrezzor.
The tears glistened in her brilliant eyes, and she exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“As soon as Simon finishes his lecture, I will persuade
him to grant your request. I have great power over him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A pang shot through my heart as I thought of Simon—the
husband of this resplendent object of my youthful
adoration. Alas! what was Helena to me? Why did I
not remember the fatal effect of her love upon me?
Why did I not remember the lessons of the spiritual
world? Are there not passions which we can never
conquer, struggle as we may? Are there not Canaanites
of the soul that can never be expelled?
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wine and refreshments were brought, and Helena
whispered something to the servant. I heard only the
last words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell him to make haste.”</span> I thought it
was a message to Simon, and that my dear benefactress
was impatient to intercede for my sister.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“pledge our future joys in this
delicate wine, and then tell me all about that wonderful
voyage they say you made into the world of spirits.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fool that I was! excited by the powerful liquor, and
still more intoxicated by the presence and smiles of that
bewitching woman who repeatedly took my hand in hers,
I profaned sacred things by lowering them to the level
of her vulgar and sensual mind. She seemed vastly entertained
by my story; and when I described the great
feast of Grecian spirits, and her own splendid appearance
in the scene, and her terrible metamorphosis, she laughed
uproariously, and said it was one of the most charming
stories she had ever heard in her life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a sound of footsteps in the adjoining room.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> she said, filling my glass, <span class="tei tei-q">“drink to the
morrow which shall be happier than to-day.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a rap or signal upon the wall.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Simon’s lecture is over,”</span> she said, rising. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is
his audience-chamber in which he receives a few pupils
who question him on the deeper points of his subject.
Their conversation would be very dull to us in our mood.
Let us retire into my chamber, until they disperse, when
we can speak to Simon alone.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I followed her to the door of the room from which the
signal had come. I hesitated, abashed, at the thought of
entering her chamber.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh come along,”</span> she said, grasping my arm. <span class="tei tei-q">“Do
not be afraid of my chamber. It has carpets which render
your feet inaudible. It has pictures and statues which
ravish your senses.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With that she drew me into the room.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was immediately seized from behind by several powerful
men, and thrown to the floor. With a peal of devilish
laughter, my betrayer fled back into the audience-chamber.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I looked up, and Magistus was regarding me with a diabolical
smile. A man was standing by him who riveted
my attention. He was black, but his face was full of
hideous white spots. One eye was gone, lids and all, so
as to leave a frightful deep hole in its place. He wore a
red turban. This strange, repulsive creature stooped to
fasten a kind of iron bracelet on my feet. I watched
him in silence. He softly kissed the top of my foot unseen
by the others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I knew him. It was Ethopus. Poor Ethopus!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Helena peered in at the door with her beautiful, laughing
face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How does my boy-lover like my bed-chamber?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How could you betray me in this atrocious manner?”</span>
said I, indignantly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Magistus offered me a beautiful diamond ring to get
you into his power. You know we women could never
resist the fascination of diamond rings!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And my poor sister!”</span> I exclaimed, in despair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“True, I had forgotten about her. It is time to
dress for the amphitheatre. The gladiators interest
me very little, but I would not miss seeing a woman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>eaten up by the lion, even for a diamond ring. Good-bye.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The demon departed. The vision of the woman-serpent
in the world of spirits was a prophecy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had fallen again—this time how low! into what an
abyss!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The amphitheatre was open! and great Heavens! I
was bound hand and foot and cast into a dungeon.

The day preceding these surprising events, Beltrezzor
had taken the keeper of the prison
aboard the new ship which lay at the pier. He
had shown him the immense treasures in his rosewood
boxes—the accumulation of a long life and successful
trade in the far Eastern countries which abound in diamonds
and precious stones.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Euphorbus opened his eyes in great astonishment. He
had never seen so much wealth before. To his feeble
arithmetic it was absolutely incalculable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Euphorbus,”</span> said my uncle, looking toward the blue
line of the sea which was visible in the distance, <span class="tei tei-q">“if this
vessel sails from this point to-morrow evening at four
o’clock, do you think she could get out of the river and
to sea before night came on, to escape any vessel started
in pursuit of her half an hour after she weighed anchor?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, she could not be overtaken by any sail now in
the river?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I make liberal calculations. I say half an hour, but
she will have an hour or two hours the start.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then she is perfectly safe,”</span> said the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Euphorbus!”</span> continued my uncle, looking him in
the face, <span class="tei tei-q">“you are a Gaul. Away over there lies your
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beautiful country, with its glorious mountains, its swift
rivers, its rich fields, its vineyards, its brave warriors.
Do you not wish to see it again?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said the soldier with a sigh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here you are a stranger, an exile, a prisoner yourself.
What are these Romans to you, hereditary enemies, that
you should obey them? robbers and murderers of your
friends and countrymen, that you should love them?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I despise them,”</span> said Euphorbus, gruffly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In Gaul you could be happy. You could return to
your old home perhaps.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Romans have burnt it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You could rebuild it. You could take care of your
mother in her old age. You could have a wife at your
side and children about your knees.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do not talk about these things!”</span> said the Gaul.
<span class="tei tei-q">“They sadden me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Talk about them? You shall have them; they are
yours. This vessel is yours; one-half of that immense

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mine? mine?”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, yours, on one condition.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What condition?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That you bring my little Mary out of the amphitheatre
to-morrow—”</span> and the old man, overpowered by
the strain upon his feelings, burst into tears.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Euphorbus was deeply moved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You ask an impossibility! Oh that I could—”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Will you if you can?”</span> exclaimed the old man,
earnestly seizing him by the hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Certainly I will—”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is all I ask!”</span> said Beltrezzor. <span class="tei tei-q">“Leave it to me.
Let me into your private room at three o’clock and I
will explain everything to you. If you are not satisfied
you can then refuse.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You speak mysteries,”</span> said the Gaul; <span class="tei tei-q">“but you

life is not much, and I am willing to risk it for you and
your little Mary as you call her.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My uncle had been twice every day to visit his niece.
The more he saw of her helplessness, her purity, her
suffering and her terror, the more she entwined herself
about his heart, and the more resolutely did he labor to
achieve her deliverance. She clung to him so tenderly,
and as the fatal hour approached her fear of the lion
became so heartrending, that the old man could hardly
tear himself from her embraces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Roman guard, accustomed to him, received his
coins smilingly and scarcely noticed his coming out.
For three days before the Sabbath he had worn a green
shade over his eyes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I got dust in them,”</span> said he to the soldiers, <span class="tei tei-q">“and an
old man’s eyes are weak.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three o’clock, Sabbath, arrived. Beltrezzor was
admitted into the private room of the keeper. The
amphitheatre was crowded, and crowds were still pressing
on the outside for admission. The games and
combats were going on, to the great delight of the
immense audience, for they occasionally shook the building
with shouts of laughter and thunders of applause.
The huge lion, irritated by these noises and raging with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hunger, sent up roar after roar, which appalled the
stoutest hearts among the spectators.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Euphorbus, stern and pale, came into his office.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now for your plan,”</span> said he to Beltrezzor. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
now or never.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My uncle drew from the ample folds of his robe a
package, which he laid on a table.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“attention! Mary and I are to
change places. She is to come out with you, disguised
as her uncle. I am to remain in the dungeon, disguised
as Mary.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Euphorbus staggered back with protruded eyes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And to be thrown to the lion yourself?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is the only way,”</span> said the old man, slowly and
meekly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Euphorbus fell upon his neck and kissed his cheek:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have heard that heroes were sometimes elevated
into gods; but you are the only man of whom I could
believe it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You see,”</span> continued Beltrezzor, <span class="tei tei-q">“here is a mask of
the finest parchment, painted in imitation of Mary’s face,
with long beautiful golden hair attached to the headpiece.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is indeed an astonishing likeness. The face is
perfect. And where is the mask in imitation of yours?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He untied a string behind his neck, and drew off his
hair and beard at once. He was a beardless bald old
man. He wore his mask.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Any one wearing this would be mistaken for me.
There was one difficulty about the eyes. We got over
that by wearing the green shade. There was another
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>about the nose and mouth. She must hold her handkerchief
to her face, as is natural in grief. The illusion will
be complete.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Here are two flat pieces of cork,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“to
be put into my sandals, which are peculiarly constructed
so as to conceal them. That will add an inch to Mary’s
height. Then you see my turban is so arranged that a
little traction here elevates it an inch more. That will
make it right, for she is nearly as tall as I am. The robes
you know we can simply exchange.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man dwelt upon these details until he convinced
Euphorbus that the singular exchange was perfectly
feasible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The voice of Simon Magus was now heard in the courtyard.
He had just looked into Mary’s window to see
that his victim had not escaped. He threw the guard
some money. He then spoke to three men who stood
before him with long poles in their hands, each pole
having an iron hook at the end of it. He spoke so loud
that Mary and every one heard him:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“You will stand inside the iron railing and watch the

or the lower half of the body, let him alone. When he
begins upon the chest, drag the body away from him

heart uninjured. If you cannot do it, I will give the

That will save my prize and satisfy the people.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After this horrible speech he entered the amphitheatre
by a private way and resumed his seat near the gorgeous
chair of Lelius.

time.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They entered the courtyard. Euphorbus gave the
guards double money.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Our poor old friend,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is overwhelmed
with grief to-day. He cannot speak. It is his last visit.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They passed into the dungeon. Mary was crouching in
one corner, white as a corpse. She sprang to her uncle’s
arms. She could not speak; she could not weep. Terror
had paralyzed the fountains of thought and sorrow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I have come to save you, my child,”</span> said the old
man, <span class="tei tei-q">“Courage! and you will be free in ten minutes.
Lazarus is in the street waiting for you. Martha is on a
beautiful ship waiting for you. In one hour you will be
on the blue sea sailing away from this awful city.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary stared at him in wild surprise.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Free? Lazarus waiting! and Martha?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The transition from total despair to hope was too much
for her weak nerves. She swooned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The old man knelt by her side, kissing her hands and
chafing her temples while the great tears rolled down
his cheeks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Too bad! too bad!”</span> said <a name="corr339" id="corr339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Euphorbus</span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“when time
is so precious”</span>—and he busied himself in forcing a
stimulus into her mouth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She revived presently and sat up.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You say I may be saved, uncle. Now tell me how.
I am calm and can comprehend you perfectly.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beltrezzor proceeded to explain everything as he had
done to Euphorbus. She heard him patiently, and then
said in a quiet tone:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And, poor good man! do you think I will permit
you to be eaten by the lion in my place? Oh no, that
is impossible. Think of some other plan.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is no other way. I shall not be eaten by
the lion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why not?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Because I am not a Christian. You are condemned
for heresy. I am a Gentile.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But they will kill you for contriving my escape, and
this good keeper also.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh no! That offence is not punishable with death.
They will fine me heavily, but I am rich and can pay.
The keeper will escape with you and protect you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After much persuasion and argument on one side
and many doubts and questionings on the other, Mary’s
scruples were at last overcome, and the transformation in
both parties effected so adroitly that detection seemed
impossible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary suddenly turned her earnest eyes on Beltrezzor’s
face.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Uncle, if you deceive me in this matter, it will
kill me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Courage! my sweet girl,”</span> said the old man, smiling—<span class="tei tei-q">“come
what may. I shall rest better to-night than I
did last night; and the sun will shine for me more beautifully
to-morrow than it has to-day.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come, come,”</span> said Euphorbus, <span class="tei tei-q">“we must be going.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Oh the anguish of that parting!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary put the green shade over her eyes and the handkerchief
to her mouth and walked slowly but bravely out
with the keeper. The guard let them pass. One fellow
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>looked closely after them, and then stepped to the window
and looked in. Mary with her golden tresses falling
over her shoulders was kneeling in prayer!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who can imagine the thoughts of that brave old man,
as he knelt in the woman’s dress, with the lion’s growl
in his ear! How eagerly he listened! How freely he
breathed when he heard no interruption in the courtyard;
no outcry; no alarm. They are safe! How he lifted
his heart to heaven!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Did he spend that last hour in prayer? To what God
did he pray? What faith did he offer up as his claim to
salvation? What matters it? Had he not kept the commandments
of God?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Was not his soul free from irreverence and profanity
and theft and murder and adultery and perjury and
uncharitableness? Did he not love his neighbor more
than himself?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This disciple of Zoroaster, was he not a child of God?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The hour passed. There was a solemn hush in the
grand amphitheatre. The dead gladiators were dragged
from the arena. Sliding panels were withdrawn and
the great Næmean lion was seen behind his iron bars
furiously lashing his sides with his tail.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The herald of Lelius cried with a loud voice:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Bring forth the woman!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a great rustling and stir in the vast audience.
Every one held his breath. A sudden outcry was raised
from the prison:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“She has escaped!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was echoed by a thousand hoarse whispers in the
crowd—<span class="tei tei-q">“She has escaped!”</span> There was a tremendous
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>excitement. All stood upon their feet. How? where?
when? by whom? echoed from all sides. Simon Magus,
a picture of flaming wrath, leaped into the arena and ran
through the walk enclosed by iron railings that led into
the prison.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He returned in a moment dragging the poor, old, bald-headed
and beardless man by the arms, and holding up
the female mask in the air, he exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The woman and the keeper have fled; but here is
the miscreant; here is the criminal! Clear the arena
and give him to the lion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Give him to the lion!”</span> echoed thousands of voices,
followed by thunders of applause.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A tall, stern-looking man, in the front row of seats,
sprang to his feet and looking over to Lelius, exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Justice! justice! This man is no Christian; this
man is no heretic.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“To the lion—to the lion!”</span> interrupted the multitude
with fiercer yells than before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus motioned significantly to the governor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“To the lion,”</span> said Lelius, waving his hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I defy you,”</span> said the speaker, in a loud and stern
voice—<span class="tei tei-q">“I defy you to throw him to the lion.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the name of the Senate and people of Rome I
warn you that this man, Beltrezzor of Persia, is a Roman
citizen.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Silence was partly restored; all eyes glaring upon the
speaker as he continued.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Not by birth nor by purchase, but by special decree
of the Senate for commercial services rendered the
Roman empire by this man, one of the wealthiest and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>noblest men of the East. I am his agent and correspondent
for Antioch. I have seen him before. I know him,
and I can prove what I say.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Release the Roman citizen,”</span> said Lelius in a proud
and haughty tone, rising from his seat.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whilst he was speaking Beltrezzor sank gently to the
ground. He had been released by an authority higher
than that of Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He is dead!”</span> exclaimed a thousand voices at
once.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He died of fear,”</span> said Simon Magus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He died of joy,”</span> said the voice from the benches;
<span class="tei tei-q">“for that face is the face of an angel.”</span>

Of all these things I was ignorant. I was bound
and in prison, helpless, unfriended, unable to
communicate with my friends. I bitterly repented
having disobeyed my uncle’s orders. I cursed
Demetrius and Simon Magus and Helena and Magistus.
I cursed myself. Mary perhaps was devoured by the
lion! Or if saved, she and Martha and Beltrezzor were
out on the blue sea, and I left to perish in my folly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A day or two afterward I observed that our prison
ward had received a considerable accession of captives.
I was then told by the keeper that a female heretic condemned
to the lion had escaped, and that Lelius had
ordered the arrest of all the Christians in the city, hoping
to ferret out the parties who had assisted her. How my
heart leaped for joy! My sister was saved!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My own captivity became a little more endurable. I
delighted to think of my friends sailing away over the
white-crested waves for the happy land of Gaul. I
seemed to feel the fresh sea wind in my own hair and
to hear the cool water dashing against the sides of their
vessel. Alas! my own fate, how different!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I expected every hour to see the ugly and cunning face
of Magistus peering in at my door. Several days and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nights passed, and he did not come. I knew he had not
forgotten me. I knew he was only preparing himself
for some extraordinary villainy and cruelty against me.
I was right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Late one evening my door suddenly opened, and Magistus
entered the dungeon, followed by Ethopus. The
latter bore an immense roll of some kind of cloth under
his arm.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Magistus stood contemplating me for several minutes
with folded arms and the old diabolical sneer on his
face. Ethopus stepped behind him with downcast eyes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> he said, slowly, <span class="tei tei-q">“for the greatest, sweetest
revenge which any man in this world has ever enjoyed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You have been the bane, the curse, the evil genius
of my life. I have always hated you; I know not why,
but that it so pleased me. If you had perished in the
desert as I designed, all would have been well. Simon
would have procured the body of Mary, and we should
have been gods in power and glory and pleasure. If you
had not escaped my dungeon in Bethany, I would not be
at this moment an exile and an outcast. You have eluded
me twice. You are cunning. You have eluded the grave
itself; but now, my amiable nephew, your time has really
come.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I respect my family too much, I respect your own
distinguished merits too much, to doom you to any
common ignoble death. Your friend Helena and I
have put our brains together to devise something for
your especial honor. We have achieved it. It is striking,
original, charming. Listen.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Our plan could not be carried out without absolute
power. I have it. Do you see this diamond ring with
this great seal upon it? That is the ring of the Roman
governor. He who presents it to any officer, soldier,
jailer, servant of the government, is to pass untouched,
unquestioned. His word is law. When he speaks, it is
obedience or death. This absolute power is given me
for this whole evening by virtue of the ring.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Helena obtained this favor from Lelius. Who but
she could have done it? Who can say how she did it?
Ah! she is deep; she is cunning; she is irresistible.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now see what we intend to do. This cloth is a stiff
heavy woollen, thoroughly saturated with bituminous substances.
We intend to bind your arms down to your
side and roll your body tightly up in this cloth, merely
leaving out your head. This, when ignited, will burn
slowly but brightly, and make a beautiful candle of you.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But you will fall over, you say. Oh no: a strong
iron rod run deep into the ground will pass through the
outer layer of the cloth and keep you steady by penetrating
in a long, sharp, needle-like point under your chin
and through your mouth. Could there be anything more
ingenious than that?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will be taken out in a cart to the great public
square opposite the palace of Simon. There are twelve
of you. Christian candles I have named you. You will
be stationed immediately opposite our grand portico.
Helena and I, arm in arm, will witness your combustion
from that point. It is pleasant in a great crowd to know
where one’s true love is standing.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is time for the fireworks to begin. The square is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>already crowded. We have rolled up the others snugly.
They will call for you in a few minutes. All the orders
have been given and they will be obeyed.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> he continued, turning to Ethopus. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come,
my old jolly, spotted dog of Egypt! get to work. Simon
says his last training made a perfect machine of you.
Be quick and bind this old friend and master of yours.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My feelings of horror and of terror during this diabolical
monologue, can be better imagined than described.
I was dumbfounded. I said nothing. I regarded a
speedy death as now inevitable. I looked anxiously at
Ethopus, who stoically unrolled the cloth. He took out
a strong leather band or girdle. He advanced toward
me. He seemed impassive as a stone. I gave myself
up in despair.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A moment of awful suspense—and all was changed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Quick as thought Ethopus turned and dashed Magistus
against the wall, throwing the band over his head at the
same time. He pulled it down over his chest and buckled
it tightly, securing his arms at his side. He drew the
signet-ring of Lelius from his finger and threw it to me.
Curses and struggles were in vain; for Ethopus seemed
strong as a lion and animated with a terrible fury.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In another moment Ethopus hurled him upon his
back, and seating himself upon his body, took a knife
from his pocket and cut off half his tongue. He then
deliberately passed a stout pin through the stump and
tied a strong thread behind the pin. He thus stopped
the blood which was pouring out of the wretch’s mouth and
gurgling in his throat. He was now dumb like Ethopus.
He could not betray him. He could not escape him.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This was one of the most horrible scenes I ever witnessed.
It had evidently been deliberately planned. I
was chained against the wall and could not stir. I called
out to Ethopus to stop, not to cut out his tongue, not to roll
him up in the cloth, but to leave him bound and gagged
until we escaped. He paid no more attention to my
entreaties, to my excitement, than if I was not present.
He seemed deaf, dumb, blind, insensible to everything
except to the one master resolution of his soul.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He wound the body carefully up in the bituminous
cloth and secured it with leather thongs. It was a
shocking sight. He then removed my bolts and chains
and set me free. He led me sternly and forcibly to the
door, and we passed out, leaving Magistus to his terrible
fate. He had fallen into the very pit that he had dug
for me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was no one in the hall as we came out. Ethopus
took the opposite way from that by which he and
Magistus came. We soon met officers and guards. I
showed the signet-ring; no questions were asked; and we
shortly found ourselves in the street and free. What a
release!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I did not know which way to go. Ethopus drew me
toward the public square. It was crowded with people.
Swinging lamps of all colors were suspended from the
trees. There were bands of music and fireworks, and
dancing-girls and flower-girls, and men with trained
monkeys, and all the strange sights and sounds which
make a great city in high carnival so brilliant and attractive.
Heralds had announced in the afternoon that
twelve favorite disciples of the Jewish impostor would
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be burned, in the shape of candles, that night. The
interest was intense.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We came very near to Simon’s palace. It was brilliantly
illuminated. I recognized the figures of Helena
and Lelius and Simon and Demetrius promenading with
others on the grand portico. The carts or wagons came
along with the unhappy victims. There was a great
bustle in the crowd. The figures were set up on a
green knoll which elevated them above the heads of
the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the Christians sang, with a clear, sweet voice:
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Glory to God in the highest!</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">Peace on earth and good-will toward men!”</span></div>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mob hooted and yelled and applauded, each in
an uproarious manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Ready,”</span> cried an officer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The torches were applied; and twelve bright pillars of
flame rose in the air. There was wild cheering from the
crowd; but I heard a wilder cry from the spectators on
the portico of Simon. The cry was:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Magistus! Magistus!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His own friends recognized his face and witnessed his
death-struggles!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such was the origin of the Christian candles, a mode
of fatal torture afterward adopted on a grand scale by
the emperor Nero in his persecution of the disciples at
Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Poor children of Christ! They faced death in every
shape. They were crucified; they were flayed alive;
they were thrown to wild beasts; they were cast into pits
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>full of serpents; they were stoned; they were starved;
they were frozen; they were burned; but there was no
form of death which excelled in atrocity this invention
of Magistus and Helena.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Helena! Beautiful, enchanting, detestable woman!
From this point our currents of life diverged never again
to meet. When I look back, I can scarcely comprehend
the causes of the wonderful control she exercised over
my spirit. I was young, enthusiastic, and impressible;
and the senses, educated first, prolonged their sway over
the rational faculties. I have been so long delivered
from the bondage of the sensuous life, that I am astonished
that I ever found any beauty unallied to goodness,
or any fascination in aught but a pure and virtuous
love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Women who are given to luxury and pleasure; who
aspire to captivate men by the charms of the senses; who
live upon the flattering incense of lovers and admirers;
who are cunning, proud, vain, ambitious and contemptuous
toward others, are Helenas at heart. Circumstances
beyond their control may curb their wills and prevent
the outward development of their characters. But the
revealing light of the spiritual world will show them to
be selfish, sensual and cruel to a dreadful degree; and
they become the syrens of hell.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These characters are so fearfully wicked, that some may
think them gross exaggerations. Exceptional they may
be, even in these evil times; but they are the genuine
offspring of our natural lusts unsubdued and uncontrolled
by the sacred laws and life of heaven. They are
the common, every-day characters of the spheres of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the unhappy in the spiritual world, and they exist in
potency, if not in act, in every human being whose heart
is alienated from God, or whose ruling love is the love
of self.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had no time to philosophize in this manner, when I
knew that the friends of Magistus had recognized his
face before it was concealed by the fatal flames. A keen
and rapid pursuit would immediately follow in every
direction. To get out of the city was our first thought,
our only safety. If we took the roads to the interior of
the country, we could certainly be overtaken. If we
struck out eastwardly for the sea-beach, we might pick
up some fisherman’s boat and escape to sea. We took
the latter course.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We walked rapidly, and were many miles up the coast
before midnight. I was fresh and under high excitement,
and Ethopus seemed capable of all endurance.
I occupied the time in telling him the whole history of
his brother Anthony, and in thanking him over and over
again for my extraordinary deliverance. The poor, dumb
man could only manifest his delight by shaking my
hand and patting me on the shoulder, which he repeatedly
did.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several hours more and I was thoroughly fatigued.
Just before dawn we lay down under a great tree on the
banks of a little stream which was perpetually tripping
from the mountains toward the sea, bearing its crystal
tokens from the spirit of liberty in the one to the kindred
soul in the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I awoke, the sun was high in the heavens.
Ethopus was bathing his feet in the little river. He
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>could not bear to disturb me, as I appeared so exhausted
and so sound asleep. He pointed smilingly to a little
boat, which we had not discovered in the darkness of the
night. There was one ark of hope and safety. I felt reassured.
We had nothing to eat but some apples, which
we had plucked by the way. We made this frugal meal,
and if we had put to sea immediately, the whole story
of my life, from this point, might have been different.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The morning was bright and balmy. A little silver
mist rose softly from the woods, the leaves of which were
twinkling with dew. The sea’s surf, which at times is so
white and boisterous, rippled gently against the yellow
beach. The singing of birds was heard here and there
in the branches, and now and then a great shining fish
flapped up out of the water. The air was sweet and
serene, the sky soft and pure. <span class="tei tei-q">“This heavenly peace
and repose of nature,”</span> said I to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“is neither
silence nor solitude!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the most beautiful things in the world to me is
a little stream of clear water, afar off in the country
among the green hills, breaking into sounds and colors
over the stones and pebbles in its path. I could sit by
the hour on the banks of such a lovely rivulet, looking
into its face and listening to its music. It is there, if ever,
that the breathings of the spirit world upon the heart
endeavor to break forth from the lips in poesy and
song.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Touched that morning with this delightful and child-like
love of nature, I could not rest satisfied until I had
bathed my weary limbs and body in the cooling stream.
I dallied a long time among the ripples and in the shadow
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the overhanging trees, forgetful of the painful past and
the uncertain future.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A sharp cry from Ethopus, who was getting the boat
ready, suddenly aroused me from my dream. He pointed
down the beach. Before I had put on my robe, I heard
the tramp of horses, and in a few moments we were surrounded
by a troop of cavalry and taken prisoners.
Bound tightly and mounted behind two of the soldiers,
we were hurried back to Antioch and cast into separate
dungeons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I lay there for several weeks neglected and alone. I
had at least no fear of a visit from Magistus. A visitor,
however, at last appeared. It was Demetrius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Lazarus,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I reproach myself for the part I
took in decoying you into the house of Simon and betraying
you into the hands of Magistus. It was not well
done toward a fellow-student of the Platonic philosophy.
I have labored to make you amends. I have saved your
life, but it was a hard struggle. Ethopus was thrown to
the lion. Helena pouted and fumed because you did not
share his fate. Lelius was for a long time inflexible. I
have gained something for you, although not much. You
are condemned for life to the chain-gang of criminals who
are compelled to labor on the public works. It is a sad
fate, but you are young. Time, the revolutionist, sometimes
releases the bound.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Life is sweet,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I thank you. I forgive
your wrong to me. I forgive Helena and Simon. I
will pray for them and you. And, oh, Demetrius, let a
man, henceforth dead to the world you live in, beseech
you to extricate yourself from this terrible network of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>evil that surrounds you. Aspire to be free, just, true and
good, and you will be happy.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Where did you get this religious philosophy?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“From a greater than Plato—from Christ.”</span>

Behold me then at the age of twenty-five, innocent
of crime, sentenced to the life and labors
of a convict! My associates were the lowest
ruffians imaginable. My fare was coarse and sometimes
revolting. I was locked up alone at night in a dark cell.
I slept on a pallet of straw. From sunrise to sunset I
was compelled to labor on the public works, chained by
the leg to another creature as miserable as myself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Young as I was, I had already met with strange adventures
and made hairbreadth escapes. I was long buoyant
and hopeful, and was constantly expecting some lucky
turn of the wheel of fortune. There was, indeed, very
little rational ground of hope. My uncle Beltrezzor was
dead. My sisters had escaped to the other end of the
world, and were not likely to return. Not one of the
few Christians of the city knew anything about my being
there, for I had seen no one but Beltrezzor. Demetrius
alone knew my whereabouts, and by command of Simon
he had entered a false name for me on the books of the
prison. So I was lost and buried from the social world
in which I had moved.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I did not believe that my imprisonment would be of
long duration. Young, educated, wealthy, I thought I
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was needed by the infant Church. The subject of the
greatest miracle of Christ, my very presence was an argument
in favor of Christianity. Then my experiences in
the spiritual world had given me knowledge superior to
that of all the disciples; knowledge necessary to the
organization of the faith upon truly rational principles.
To suspect even that one so valuable to the holy cause
could be imprisoned for life, without a future, without a
mission, was to doubt the wisdom of Providence and the
verity of my death and resurrection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was thus that the secret pride of my selfhood buoyed
me up in the direst adversity, and that my own self-righteousness
became the fountain of hope!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Notwithstanding all this, I remained a captive at hard
labor for forty years of my manhood! As long as the
children of Israel were in the wilderness, so long was I
in the convict prison of Antioch! Terrible thought!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I emerged from my prison-grave into the world
and the Church again, I was old and feeble and bronzed
and broken, forgotten by all men, a cipher in the sphere
of thought and life in which I had expected to occupy
so commanding a position.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wicked and detestable emperors, those monsters
of nature, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero, had
successively governed and cursed the Roman state. The
Christian religion had spread into all countries; into
Syria and Parthia and Arabia, into Egypt and Abyssinia,
into Spain and Gaul and Britain, by the zealous labors
and fiery devotion of Paul and Peter and Barnabas and
Philip and James and hundreds of lesser lights of the
new faith.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this and thousands of other strange events had
occurred without my knowledge, without my participation.
The great world moved on without me. I knew
as little of it in my prison as a child knows of the sea,
who bathes his little feet in the surf that breaks upon the
beach at his father’s door.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This great lapse of time, an entire manhood, so devoid
of incident, so uninteresting to the general reader, was
my real life. All that had happened previously was my
childhood. It was in this fearful school of captivity and
sorrow and labor and solitude and darkness, that I became
a man and a Christian. Looking backward, I am
filled with gratitude for the wisdom and goodness of God,
which infused such health and blessing into the cup of
bitterness which I was compelled to drink.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I passed through three great spiritual eras during my
captivity. Life does not consist in external events, but in
the revelation of spiritual states. This alone is the true
biography.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first era was one of intense resistance to my fate.
My disagreeable surroundings annoyed and irritated me.
The unaccustomed labor in the burning sun was almost
too great for my strength. I loathed my companions and
my keepers. I loathed my tasks. Still greater suffering
was occasioned by my losses; the loss of friends and
relatives; of books and study; of the delightful society
of woman; of all the thousand little things which constitute
the comfort and charm of civilized life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hope lingered long, and died a slow but painful death
in my heart. I made many efforts to escape—all of
which failed, and brought upon me terrible punishments.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>I was starved and scourged repeatedly, and finally
branded for an attack made upon one of my keepers, in
which I nearly succeeded in killing him. These things
called out and developed all the evil qualities of my
nature. Let the smoothest-faced, sweetest-tongued and
gayest-hearted man in the world undergo what I have
undergone, and he will discover how many unrecognized
devils have been dormant in the serene and undisturbed
depths of his being.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wounded and bleeding in my self-love and self-respect,
my sufferings, physical and mental, seemed to have a
destructive effect upon my spiritual nature. Destruction
of the old precedes a new order of things. Along with
hope, faith also sickened and died. For a long time I
consoled myself by recalling my wonderful experiences
in the spiritual world. I prayed, and recited to myself
the sweet promises of Scripture to those in affliction.
But as months and years rolled away, despair overpowered
me. I began to doubt the truth of religion, the
reliability of my own memory, and even the very existence
of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So little depth of earth had the good seed found in my
heart! I, who thought I loved and believed in Christ;
who had seen him in both worlds; who conceived myself
ready and able to preach his true doctrine to mankind;
thus tried in the fiery furnace of temptation, found myself
all dross, thoroughly skeptical and wicked, worse than
the ignorant convicts and keepers around me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What mortal can comprehend the meaning of those
mysterious words of the Divine Man on the cross:
<span class="tei tei-q">“My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I felt also that God had forsaken me. When the little
religious light I had, faded away in my soul, I was taken
possession of by demons, male and female. I verily
believe that I was, for a while, what the world calls insane.
I became proud, and supercilious, and scoffing.
I was ambitious as Simon, cruel as Magistus, sensual and
abandoned as Helena. Escaped from those wretches
in the body, my spirit became the sport and prey of
infernal spirits similar to them. I envied the power, the
glory, the magic of Simon. At night I dreamed only of
bacchanalian orgies in a Grecian heaven, and awoke
parched and feverish and excited and maddened, as if
some syren-like Helena had kissed me in my sleep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This wretched state lasted about ten years. It culminated
in a great illness; for relief or death had become
the alternative. The illness of a convict in prison! Cast
upon my pallet of straw, without friends, without nurses,
without proper diet or medicine, frequently without
water; what days and nights of suffering and anguish
did I experience!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was a long, long sickness. The stage of excitement
was accompanied with wild delirium, and my imagination
was haunted by fiery figures of infernal spirits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then exhaustion came, and forgetfulness. Nature
slowly rallied; after that, thought returned, strength and
feeling came back. My sisters and Beltrezzor and Jesus
loomed up away off, as pleasant pictures or beautiful
dreams. Many sweet little scenes of my happy childhood
revisited me in charming memories. I lay for hours in
peaceful trances. I had consoling visions. The poor
convict’s cell was illumined with a glory not its own.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One night I saw the house that was building for me in
the heavens. It was rising in stately grandeur. Oh it
was beautiful! but still unfinished. Mary Magdalen was
toiling away with earnest brow and face more angelic
than ever. Many shining spirits were about her. I was
lying some distance off, asleep in the shadow of a great
rock. She said to her companions with a sweet smile:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He will awake presently and help me build.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One day I heard the voice of my father saying to John
the Baptist,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The crisis is over; he will be saved; we must teach
him the power of the Lord’s Prayer.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I know not whether this was a dream or a genuine
vision. But I repeated the Lord’s Prayer feebly and
with folded hands. The effect was wonderful. A great
light shone around me. The air was full of little cherub
forms. Heavenly music was heard in the distance. The
deepest chords of my being were touched. The flood-gates
of contrition were reopened. Faith returned. I
wept. I was happy—oh, so happy!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This also may have been a dream, but it was a potent
medicine; for after that, my recovery was amazingly
rapid. I then entered into a second and very different
phase of my spiritual life. The devil, after casting me
repeatedly into the water and the fire, and rending me
sorely, had departed. But I knew full well that he only
departs for a season—that his return is as sure as the
rising of the tides. I knew that the only way to keep
him out, was to refurnish my house on the heavenly
model.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now my knowledge of spiritual things came to be of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>immense advantage. Not an abstract, theoretical knowledge
of them, but a knowledge derived from sight and
hearing. I had seen, felt and studied the angelic sphere
of life. I knew what it was. I had discovered three great
elements in that sphere, and determined to put them all
into action in my own life, so as to bring my spirit into
interior communion with angels and the Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first element was profound humility and reverence.
God only enters the soul which is thoroughly emptied
of self. A proud Christian is a devil in disguise. The
angels are so thoroughly divested of the selfhood, that
they live and labor only for others’ good; and that is
living and laboring for God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prayer is the means by which humility and reverence
are cultivated. It does not change the Unchangeable; it
only brings the soul into that state in which it is receptive
of the divine love and wisdom. I determined, therefore,
to pray—for I had long neglected prayer—and to pray
regularly, systematically, earnestly, and especially in the
form or after the manner that the Lord himself had
appointed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second element of angelic life was cheerfulness.
The cheerfulness of angels flows from the peace and joy
in which they live. They cannot be present in a sphere
of gloom and darkness. The silent, tearful, mourning,
austere, ascetic Christian, cuts himself off from angelic
consolations, and renders his regeneration doubly painful
and difficult. Tears and fastings and scourgings and
solitude and fantastic self-denials do not lead to heaven.
They block up the way thither with needless difficulties.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I determined, therefore, to be cheerful; to accept my
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lot with graceful resignation; to have a genial word and
pleasant smile for every one; to avoid reveries and broodings
which kept the past continually in painful contrast
with the present; to make a final surrender of all my
grand ambitions and glorious expectations; and to take a
heartfelt pleasure in the trifles of life, such as may be
found even within the walls of a prison.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The third element of the angelic life was useful activity.
An idle angel is an impossibility. They are all busy as
bees; and like those little preachers to mankind, each
labors intently, not for his own special benefit, but for the
good of all the rest. Their cheerfulness and usefulness
run in equal and parallel streams, and they are both
proportioned to their reverence and humility.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I determined therefore to work willingly; to accept
my hard tasks as those appointed of God; to be no
longer an eye-servant but an earnest, faithful, intelligent
co-operator in building, repairing and improving the
magnificent temples, baths, aqueducts, walls, quays and
fortifications of Antioch; to treat my fellow-laborers as
brethren, not by descending to their gross level, but by
striving to lift them as well as myself up to the height of a
noble and unselfish manhood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this was facile and beautiful in theory, difficult and
painful in practice. The struggle was intense; and many,
many dark and miserable days alternated with my bright
ones. It was the great warfare of my life, less imposing
than my struggles with Magistus and Helena, but far more
productive of results. It was a process by which good
was substituted for evil; but as fast only as the evil was
thoroughly repented of and put away. It was a process
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of growth by which the germ of the heavenly life, penetrating
through the dead shell of the old nature, passed
upward into a serener light and larger liberty. It was a
death and a resurrection. How small an affair was my
first resurrection in comparison with this!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Twenty years or more were spent in the great combat
between my old natural man and the new spiritual man
which was being conceived, born, nourished, instructed
and vitalized within me. I am still engaged in the same
conflict. But after twenty years, I felt that the good had
attained a permanent ascendency—that duty had become
pleasure—that self was so far subdued that I expected
nothing, desired nothing for myself alone, and experienced
a serene delight in promoting the happiness of
others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reader need not think that a convict’s prison
afforded no opportunities for the great work of regeneration,
and for the development of Christian character.
The rainbow that shines in the cloud, and glitters in the
dew-drop, is the same. The divine influx is identical in
the greatest things and in the least. The patience, the
meekness, the kindness to others, the obedience to law,
the truthfulness, the industry, the honesty which can be
exhibited in the lowliest sphere of human life, have no
sweeter odor, no greater worth in the sight of heaven
when they are displayed on the throne of the Cæsars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I worked faithfully at all my tasks until my overseers
respected me so much that they did not watch me at all.
I was always ready to assist every one with word and
deed, until my power over my fellow-prisoners was such
that my voice of intercession could suspend a quarrel or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even suppress a riot. I delighted to instruct these poor
degraded fellows in the truths of religion; and when they
turned a deaf ear to these, I could still please them with
scraps of poetry or history or science. It was a special
pleasure to nurse the sick; and in the course of twenty or
thirty years, hundreds and even thousands felt the benefit
and the blessing of my presence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This steady growth of a good and useful character in
spite of the sneers and rebuffs of the ill-disposed, and
in the face of mighty difficulties, brought substantial comforts
to myself also. I was released from strict confinement;
I was made overseer of a considerable party; I
was allowed liberties I had not known before; and I was
fed with abundance from the officers’ table. Thus, with
advancing years, I became contented and happy, and my
means of being useful to others were greatly increased.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was permitted to plant flowers and vines in the
interior courtyard of our prison. After long and patient
labor I adorned and beautified the spot so greatly that it
attracted the attention of every visitor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The mission of flowers is like that of poetry, to
enchant, to elevate, and to purify. Therefore the
Spring comes annually to shower her myriads of fragrant
little lyrics upon the world!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seemed a shame to constrain these sweet and free
children of the air and sunlight to illumine the interior
of a dungeon and to live with criminals; but I remembered
that the angels whom they represent, delight
to visit the humblest spot and to assist the most forlorn
and helpless creatures of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had been in prison about fifteen years without seeing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a book, when a singular old Greek character was confined
with us for some nameless crime. He was taciturn
and stately, and evidently a man of education. He had
a copy of the Tragedies of Eschylus which the guard had
not taken from him, although parchments so well executed
as that, were of considerable value. He seemed
to know Eschylus by heart, and he loaned the book to
me. With what delight I devoured it!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was to me a whole flower-garden of sweets and
beauties. The sad fate of Orestes, haunted by the Furies,
struck the tenderest chords in my heart; and I contemplated
with the joy of kinship and sympathy the
grandeur of Prometheus chained to the rock, for holding
in his possession secret knowledge which no tortures
could compel him to reveal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I, too, was to learn the sanctity of silence!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One day the old Greek, when working on a pier, suddenly
plunged twenty feet into the rapid Orontes. He
struck out boldly down the river for the sea, and the
boat sent after him did not overtake the desperate
swimmer.  He left Eschylus behind him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had been in prison about twenty-five years, when I
came into possession of another and far greater book. A
young Jew was condemned to hard labor for striking a
Roman officer who had insulted his sister. He fell sick
almost immediately, and was carried off by grief and a
rapid consumption. I nursed him closely, and he seemed
much attached to me until he discovered that I was a
Christian. He became at once stern and cold and uncommunicative,
and ended by requesting the keeper to
provide him with another nurse or none at all.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He died not long after, and I was surprised at receiving
a message from his deathbed. He thanked me for
my kindness to him, and begged me to accept from him
a beautiful little copy of the Psalms of David.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What a treasure I found it! It was a mirror of my
own struggles; of my hopes and fears; of my deep
humiliations and my ecstatic triumphs. It let me into
the presence of angels. It was like the voice of God
calling to little Samuel in the dead of night.

One day I was summoned from my labors into
a kind of reception-room to meet a visitor. A
visitor! I had been imprisoned thirty years and
no one had ever called to see me. I had forgotten the
outer world and supposed it had forgotten me. It was
with surprise and some trepidation that I advanced to
present myself to the stranger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was of small size, ugly, stoop-shouldered and bald.
His face was sallow, his nose aquiline, his brows heavy
and joined between his eyes. His air was <a name="corr367" id="corr367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">embarrassed</span>
and timid and his speech slow. With this unprepossessing
appearance, his manner was cordial and engaging,
his tones agreeable, and when warmed up in conversation,
his features were radiant with thought and genius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This remarkable man was Paul, the apostle to the
Gentiles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After satisfying himself that I had been thirty years in
prison and that I was really Lazarus whom Christ raised
from the dead, he became very animated and communicative.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You will be interested,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“to know how I
found you out. I was called, a few days before I left
Rome on this tour to the Eastern churches, to see a dying
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>man. He was one of the most miserable wrecks I have
ever witnessed, bearing the mark of the beast and the
seal of sin. He was a Greek and his name was Demetrius.
He wished to be baptized into the Christian
faith, and to confess his sins before he died. He told
me that you had been sentenced for life under a false
name to hard labor on the public works of Antioch. He
begged, as a favor to a dying sinner, that I would visit
you if possible, and beg your pardon for the crimes he
had committed against you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It seemed that all my friends supposed I had been
burned as one of the Christian candles, on the eventful
night of the death of Magistus. My sisters and the disciples
had mourned for me as one of the first martyrs of
the new faith. Mary and Martha had arrived safely in
Gaul, and had founded a beautiful church with a convent
and Christian schools at Marseilles. Their wealth had
contributed immensely to the spread of Christianity.
They were devoted and holy women, and Paul was eloquent
in praise of their zeal and piety.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And Mary Magdalen?”</span> said I, with a slight tremor
at pronouncing the name of a woman who had of late
taken ardent possession of my thoughts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The humblest, sweetest, gentlest creature in the world!
She always wears her black veil and devotes herself to
the most menial offices. She is the grandest type I have
yet seen of the purifying and sanctifying influence of the
religion of <span class="tei tei-corr">Christ.</span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I felt a sweet glow of satisfaction at this announcement;
and old man as I was, something like a blush mounted to
my cheeks.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I learned from the great apostle the history of the
Church from its infancy to the present time. He was
modest and even depreciating in narrating his own share
in the stupendous labors of the early disciples. I was not
slow in detecting, from what he said, the immense changes
in thought and spirit which had taken place in the Christian
commonwealth since I had been withdrawn from its
sphere.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus Christ had left them a religion; Paul had made
it a theology.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul drew from me a narration of my experiences in
the spiritual world. I was very explicit and enthusiastic,
for I deemed my revelations of the utmost importance to
the Church and the world. He listened with interest, but
with evident incredulity. We exchanged ideas at some
length on all the leading questions of theology. I became
more and more anxious to impress him with the
truth of what I was saying.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Remember,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the germs which you
now plant in the Church, will expand in the form and
direction you give them for hundreds and may be thousands
of years. The slightest deviations now from the
genuine truth, will grow into gigantic errors.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you teach the destructibility of this physical globe
and the resurrection of our dead bodies from the dust,
the Church will not have a true conception of the spiritual
world, nor of the relation of that world to this.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you teach the separate and distinct personality of
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the proper or supreme
divinity of Jesus Christ will not be understood, and the
germ of polytheism will take root in your creed.</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you ignore the great judgment executed by Christ
in the world of spirits, you will fail to comprehend the
true object of his incarnation; and you will commit the
sad mistake of supposing that the next and last judgment
predicted, will take place in the world of nature.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“If you speak, as you did just now, of the blood of
Christ cleansing from sin, your hearers may fall into the
error of supposing that the material blood shed upon the
cross is what cleanses and saves from sin; whereas the
truth is, that the blood shed for the remission of sins, is
the wine of the New Testament—the spiritual truth and
spiritual life which flow forth from the Divine Man for the
healing of the nations.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So I went on, reiterating all the grand points of doctrine
which distinguished the teachings of the angels I had
conversed with, from the teachings of Paul. He became
more and more restive under my impetuous torrent of
argument, and at last rose to depart. He excused himself
on the plea of urgent business and short time. He
said he would call again if possible, and would interest
the Church in Antioch to labor for my release.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He left me with a pleasant smile. He passed into a
gallery where he met the governor of the prison. They
were conversing as they walked slowly along beneath a
window at which I had stopped. I heard Paul say,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He is evidently insane.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I wish the world was full of such madmen,”</span> was the
bluff answer of the governor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And that was the result of my interview with the great
thinker, the leading spirit of the Christian world!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Insane!
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This visit of Paul was of immense service to me. It
helped me to subdue one of the strongest points of my
selfhood. I still cherished the dream that my spiritual
knowledge had been entrusted to me for the special benefit
of the Christian Church. My only reason for wishing
to get out of prison, was that I might communicate the
Doctrine of Christ, as it appears to the angels, to my fellow-men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After mature reflection upon my conversation with Paul
and its results, I came to the conclusion that I had labored
under a great mistake and had cherished an impossible
hope. There are certain successive steps in the grand
evolution of the general human mind, which make one
revelation of truth necessary and proper at one time and
another at another. The world and the Church were not
ready for the knowledges which had been given to me.
The transition from Jewish darkness to angelic light was
too great, too sudden. A long period of twilight must
intervene—a period of literal interpretations, of janglings
and wranglings and schisms. In the fullness of time, perhaps,
and after another judgment in the world of spirits,
another church may be instituted capable of receiving
without adulteration the sublime verities of the spiritual
world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So I abandoned my mission. God knew better than I
did, and I was satisfied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is strange what a new, sweet, beautiful life sprung up
in my soul after I discovered that I had no mission in
this world to fulfill, but to spread cement between stones,
to plant flowers, to read the Psalms and to nurse my sick
fellow-prisoners. I was a new creature.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I then entered upon what I have designated as the
third state or era of my spiritual life. And this state was
so marvelous, so exceptional to all the experiences of my
fellow-men, that I shall not dwell long upon it. It may be
a thousand or two thousand years before Providence repeats
the phenomenon and produces another case like
mine; and although in the far-off perfection of the world
they will be common enough, the story of it will for centuries
fall upon the ears of men as an idle dream.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first intimation I had of a further change of state,
was received while I was reading the Scriptures. The
good Christians of Antioch, it seems, failed in procuring
my release; but they contrived to send me a copy of the
ancient Scriptures and the Gospel of Matthew. These
were priceless jewels to an old man and a prisoner dead
to all things except the life of religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One day when reading in the Psalms and applying the
thoughts to my own individual experience, I became suddenly
aware, by a kind of interior illumination, that the
secret soul-life of the Lord Jesus Christ in his combats
with the powers of hell, was embodied and concealed in
the sacred pages. They contain more wonderful things
than all the heights and depths of this external nature
which we so much admire. They contain the mysteries
of life and death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every day brought new revelations to my mind of the
interior meaning of the sacred writings. I found that the
spiritual history of the incarnation of Christ was concealed
in the narrative of the lives of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
The first chapters of Genesis, under the figure of the creation
of the world, revealed the successive steps by which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a name="Pg373" id="Pg373" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the human soul is built up from its original chaos into the
image of God. The wanderings of the Israelites from
Egypt to Canaan, was the spiritual history of every man’s
regeneration. And the prophets—oh, the prophets! with
their dark sayings and grand imagery, concealed with a
mystic veil the most beautiful and holy truths of the spiritual
universe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These things were not invented by my imagination.
They were not discovered by my ingenuity. They
pre-existed in the Scriptures, but are invisible to the
mind which rests in the mere sense of the letter. Their
existence was revealed to me by an interior light, the
operation of which I did not comprehend. I learned
also that this wonderful spiritual sense of the Divine Word
was clearly understood in heaven, and was the mental
food of angels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Gospel of Matthew contains similar spiritual mysteries
enfolded in the literal story of our Lord. The
Epistles of Paul, however,—glowing, eloquent, devout,
impressive as they are—contain no interior or spiritual
signification. I saw at once that they had no organic
connection with the heavens; in other words, that they
were not divinely inspired. They were simply the earnest,
saintly utterances of a great and good man to his
brethren.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And yet,”</span> said I to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“so potent has this
zealous and eloquent apostle been in organizing the
Church, and so dense is the darkness of the natural mind,
that it would not surprise me, if in the far future the
words of Paul are reckoned of equal value with the
history of Jesus, or with the Law and the Prophets.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The peace and joy inspired by the spiritual perception
of the Word, were ineffable. My mind was in a state of
continual felicity. I began also to have the most exquisite
and beautiful dreams. I was frequently awakened
by strains of the most heavenly music, and the darkness
of my little cell was illumined by flashes of light, auroral
and rainbow colors darting and twinkling here and
there in the most surprising manner. I felt that some
organic change in my spiritual constitution was impending.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One Sabbath morning when I was reading in the
Prophets, I became suddenly aware of a presence in my
room; and lifting my eyes I beheld my father standing
before me. He was as youthful and beautiful as ever.
He was clad in shining garment, and said with a beaming
smile:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you understand what you read?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Better than I ever did before. But, O father! how
is it that you have descended into the natural world?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Have you so soon forgotten your instructions in
the world of spirits? I have not descended into the
world of nature. I see nothing material which surrounds
you. I am invisible to all eyes but yours. The change is
in yourself. Your spiritual sight has been partially opened
into the world of spirits where I am—enough to see my
form, but not my surroundings. You seem to come to me,
while I seem to come to you. You see me with your
spiritual eyes and your material surroundings with your
natural eyes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is needless to explain the philosophy, as it is impossible
to describe the joy, of this happy reunion.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Suffice it to say that my father came frequently to see
me, or I went to see him, however the case may be interpreted.
He assisted me in my studies of the Word,
and we had many long discourses on the mysteries of
regeneration. Many of these things are incommunicable
in human language, for when my spiritual sight was open,
I spoke unconsciously the language of spirits and not the
language of men; and I find it impossible to embody in
material expressions what was perfectly intelligible in my
spiritual state.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Your case,”</span> said my father, <span class="tei tei-q">“so strange and exceptional
at present, is a proof of the possibilities of the
human spirit. As long as the powers of hell reign on
earth, it will be fearfully dangerous for man to have communication
with spirits; and the Lord in his mercy will,
as far as may be possible, keep each world a secret from
the other. When He comes again with an open Word
and his angelic hosts in the far-off ages of terrestrial time,
such cases as yours may occur not unfrequently, and will
announce the approaching conjunction of heaven and
earth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This double life, this wheel within a wheel, is no part
of my earthly autobiography. I must draw the veil over
its mysteries. I am permitted, however, to tell my
readers that my uncle Beltrezzor was revealed to my
eyes. He appeared as a young man of unspeakable
beauty, clad in a purple robe of dazzling splendor. He
had become a member of a heavenly society situated
nearest to the Sun of the spiritual world. The atmosphere
in which they live is a tissue of golden light, and the
emblem of their spiritual love is a flame of sacred fire.

The old man who thus lived in both worlds, at once
escaping the common limitations of time and space, was
not withdrawn from the practical discharge of his homely
and difficult duties. Never in his life was he more faithful,
more zealous, more careful in the little every-day
affairs which really make the happiness or the misery
of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One day I was working on the walls of a new palace.
The chief architect, a man of noble character and great
influence, happened to approach very near me in one
of his rounds of inspection. He said in a pleasant
tone:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You spread your cement with very great care.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“So it ought to be,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“for the cement is the
brotherly love which binds the hearts of the brethren
together.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He lifted his hand and made a certain signal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I responded to it with another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I discover,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you are a member of that

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

I purchased some new clothes, and wandered
all day about the streets of Antioch,
astonished at my liberty. I dined at an eating-house
where several languages were spoken by the different
guests, and where every one stared at the long-bearded,
long-haired old man, with the new robes and the rough,
brown hands. Toward dark I began to feel very lonely
and miserable, and at last returned to the prison like a
dog to his kennel, and begged the favor of a night’s
lodging in my old cell.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Free! Free like a plant whose roots are dead, and
which, with no attachment to the earth, trembles at the
mercy of the wind!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I met next day with some of the Christians of Antioch.
They seemed glad that I had been released and spoke
kindly to me, but remembered the visit of Paul and his
belief that I was insane. If my opinions had been orthodox,
what a cordial reception they would have given to
the man whom Christ raised from the dead! As I had
learned the divine philosophy of silence, I said nothing to
them on spiritual subjects.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was sixty-five years old and everything was new and
strange. The pages of history during my long
incarcera<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tion had been written in blood and tears. Vespasian
occupied the throne of the Roman empire, assisted by his
son Titus, who had besieged and taken Jerusalem. The
holy temple was reduced to ashes and the city of David
was a pile of ruins. The judgment in the world of spirits
had descended upon the earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was shocked by the horrible details of the persecution
which the Christian world had suffered from the detestable
Nero; and of the crucifixion of Peter, the murder of
Paul and the martyrdom of many prominent disciples.
What Lelius had begun at the private instigation of a sorcerer
on the little stage of Antioch, too insignificant for
historical notice, had been repeated by the butcher of
Rome on the theatre of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this terrible persecution my sisters had been
driven from Marseilles. Flying for their lives, they
reached the bleak and distant shores of Britain. There
they planted the gospel banner and preached Christ to
the pagan natives. There they were still living at the
last accounts, lights in the darkness, warmth in the coldness
around them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mary Magdalen had refused to fly from the Roman
tyrants. Roused to a wild pitch of religious enthusiasm
by the atrocities perpetrated upon her fellow-Christians,
she rushed defiantly into the presence of the heathen
officers and demanded the pleasure and the glory of
dying for the name of Christ. Seeking martyrdom, she
escaped it. Astounded at this eloquent and brave woman
with disheveled hair and face flashing a wild spiritual
light, the persecutors pronounced her mad, and refused
to put her to death.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She retired to a mountain in Spain and occupied a cave
overlooking the sea. There she lived in solitude and
prayer, wearing out soul and body in contrition for the
sins of her early youth. Her sanctity and power of
healing were so great, that many pilgrims came from
remote places to receive her benediction or be healed by
her touch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Helena, the beautiful syren from whom my soul had so
narrowly escaped, deserted Simon for Lelius, and Lelius
for some Roman general, and this last for a low favorite
of Caligula. She was finally swallowed up in that hideous
whirlpool of Roman life, which was kept in motion by the
unbridled passions of male and female monsters, such as
the world has rarely seen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon Magus had been driven from Antioch at the instigation
of Helena, who had unbounded control over the
Roman legate. He retired into Samaria, where he acquired
great power and fame by his magic and sorceries.
Thousands of people in that rude country admitted his
claim to divine power. It was there that he came into
contact with the disciples of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Simon had discovered by his acute genius that a great
change had taken place in the relations between the spiritual
and natural worlds since the death and ascension of
Jesus. The old demons who had governed the world
of spirits had been cast into hell. No spells of incantation
could recall Ja-bol-he-moth or any of the great
spirits to his consultations. The magical formulas had
lost their power. The pagan oracles were becoming
silent. The influence formerly exercised by magicians
over men and Nature was evidently waning. Simon
be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>came sad, suspicious, fearful. The ground was sinking
under him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He did not attribute these singular changes to the
right cause. He believed that Jesus was only a magician
more powerful than any or all others—one who, by some
mysterious method had monopolized the subtle forces of
spirit over matter. He therefore came to the disciples
of Jesus, and was baptized into the Church. When he
thought he had sufficiently ingratiated himself with the
apostles, he offered them a large sum of money for the
magical secret by which they healed the sick and raised
the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Peter answered him indignantly:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast
thought that the gift of God may be purchased with
money!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After that exposure he went to Rome, where his
magical powers seemed to revive in the infernal atmosphere
of that wicked city. His conduct became more
and more eccentric, insolent and presumptuous. He was
clearly obsessed by devils. He manifested great aversion
to the name of Christ, and professed to repeat all of his
miracles with the greatest ease. He announced in the
height of his madness, that he would ascend to heaven
with a chariot and horses on a certain day. The amphitheatre
was crowded to suffocation. It was said that
he rose about forty feet in the air, when his chariot and
horses fell back into the arena and crushed him to
death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus perished a man whose character and actions will
seem impossible to future generations, but who was one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the typical products of a corrupt and doomed civilization.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had never known the earthly heaven of home and
wife and child. I had no country; no resting place; for
little Bethany also was laid in ashes. My old friends
and my old enemies were dead. The little church to
which I belonged in heart, was the feeblest of all religious
powers; and even that would have repudiated and expelled
me on a full declaration of my faith. The most
advanced man in the world, I was the most desolate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My face, my thoughts, my heart turned fondly to
Britain. The last time I beheld my sisters was on
that eventful night in Bethany, when they gave the
supper to Jesus, and when Mary unwittingly anointed him
for his burial. I must see them again! It was a long,
dangerous, desolate journey for a poor old man to make
alone. But my sisters called to me at evening from the
golden shadows of the west, and beckoned to me in the
night through the twinkling of the northern stars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I sailed from Antioch to Rome. Not a Christian cared
enough for the old man with heretical opinions, to pay a
friendly visit or give a kindly farewell to him whom
Christ had raised from the dead. As the ship passed
close to one of the great piers, some old convicts who were
working upon it recognized me and waved me a hearty
good-bye. With tears in my eyes I kissed my hand to
my only friends in the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On reaching Rome I was delighted to find the apostle
John who had extricated Mary and Martha from the toils
of Magistus, and who gave me a most cordial reception.
This unexpected warmth of friendship and sympathy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>infused new life into me and almost made me happy
again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To my great surprise and pleasure, this disciple whom
Jesus loved, and to whose care he committed his mother,
agreed with almost everything I had to say. He broke
the seal I had imposed upon my lips; for he had a sacred
thirst for spiritual knowledge which I felt constrained to
gratify. He received my doctrines of the resurrection of
the spiritual instead of the natural body, of judgments in
the spiritual and not in the natural world, and the grand
central truth of all truths—the supreme divinity and
absolute fatherhood of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John regretted deeply the dissensions which had already
distressed the little Church, and foresaw the errors
which would probably arise from certain dubious phrases
and unwarranted doctrines which had crept into its theology.
My whole story, he said, was so beautiful that it
ought to be true; and if true, it certainly ought to be
beautiful.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus John endorsed the very teachings for which Paul
thought me insane!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Just as I was starting for Britain, news was brought
from that cold region which rendered my journey unnecessary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My sisters were dead!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Martha, when traversing one dark night a desolate
moor to relieve a person in deep distress, was lost and
perished in the snow. When the corpse was discovered
and laid out in the little chapel of their convent, and Mary
approached it, this new sorrow, added to the multiplied
cares and labors of her life, was too much for the
over<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>burdened heart. The silver cord was gently broken, and
she stretched her own body, like a funeral pall, upon that
of her sister.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Conjoined in their lives! united in their death!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beautiful spirits, clad always in virgin white! Brides
of Christ! Twin-stars of heaven! Farewell!—until this
old body also shall drop into the dust, and the strong
bond of spiritual affinity shall draw us together again, and
bind us, to each other for ever!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John, the beloved disciple, was only visiting Rome.
He lived at Ephesus. He now entreated me to accompany
him home and spend the remnant of my days in
the peaceful shade of his humble cottage. I thanked him
warmly, but declined his invitation. There was one
more person upon earth whom I felt a strong desire to
see. That person was Mary Magdalen, the last link
which connected me with the past. The hunger of an
old man’s heart for home and friends, for sympathy and
love, was reduced to this. It was all that was left me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My feelings toward Mary Magdalen had become clearly
defined in the last ten years of my captivity. The sad
things of the past were buried and forgotten. I had
outlived, outgrown the self-righteous conceit that I was
better than she. Yea, I had discovered that she was far
better than I. I was thoroughly ashamed of the neglect,
almost amounting to scorn, with which I had treated her
in my youth. Her grand devotion to the cause of Christ,
her fiery zeal, her contrition, her penances, her humility,
her self-sacrifice, her solitude, haunted my imagination.
The martyrdom of her life was continually before me.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I resolved to make a pilgrimage to her shrine; for I
now regarded her as the saint and myself as the repentant
sinner. I would not mention love to a heart so sorely stricken
with the wounds of conscience and the sorrows
of life. I would tell her nothing. I would leave all that
to the revealing light of the spiritual world, which was now
so near us both.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I would merely see her and weep with her over the
old, sweet memories of Jesus and Martha and Mary. I
would live near her. I would work for her, without her
knowledge. I would make her comfortable without her
seeing whence it came. I would visit her in sickness. I
would close her eyes in death. All the rest should be
buried deep, deep in the recesses of a heart which had not
grown old.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I reached Marseilles and surveyed with silent grief the
ashes of the convent my sisters had built. I employed a
snug little boat and coasted along, west and south-west,
until we reached the shores of Spain, where the spurs of
the Pyrenees jut out into the Great Sea.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Landing at a little village, I was directed to a considerable
mountain near by. I made the ascent before
the heat of the day. The path made a sudden turn from
a crag which stood a thousand feet above the water; and
I found myself at the dark mouth of a cave. Near the
entrance, on the right, was a wooden cross planted in a
little bed of violets, wildly overgrown. The sky was
clear and beautiful. A perfect silence reigned around.
My heart throbbed as I approached the last earthly home
of the friend of my sisters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I looked into the cave and started back. A fearful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sense of awe came over my soul. My pilgrimage was in
vain. I stood in the presence of the dead!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In that dim and damp and empty cavern, lay a human
body, stretched upon a couch of stone. It was clad in
rusty black, with a black veil thrown over the face. She
had been long, long dead; for the feet which protruded
from her robe were bones and not feet. A scourge of
leather thongs had fallen from her hands. Engraven
deeply in the moist rock of the wall, just above her
prostrate figure, was the single word,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Magdalen.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I advanced no nearer. I knelt in prayer. I did not
weep. He who has lived in both worlds, cannot be
greatly stirred by the mutations of this. I turned away,
thinking of our beautiful house in the heavens, and sighing
to myself,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is well! It is well!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My heart now turned to John. I sailed from Marseilles,
bound for Alexandria, where I expected to take ship for
Ephesus. We never reached Alexandria. After we passed
the island of Sicily a series of terrible storms commenced,
and our little vessel was driven about like a feather on the
sea. Our hardships were great, and our labor in vain.
After many days our vessel sprang a leak, and we were
compelled to abandon her, or go to the bottom with her.
Our boat stood bravely for the shore, where some lofty
mountains loomed up through the night air. We were
capsized, and I lost consciousness. When I recovered
my senses it was daylight. The little boat was beached
quite near me. My companions were all drowned. I
was utterly alone.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was wrecked at the foot of the western range of
Mount Lebanon, on the coast of Phenicia. I found a
large and dry cave half-way up the first great spur that
overlooks the sea. I have made this my home. I turned
fisherman for a living—for I had lost all with the ship—and
the little boat was serviceable for that. I exchanged
my fish with the people a little way from the coast, for
other articles more needed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus I have lived for several years. Here I have
written this manuscript. I have chosen the Greek language
for its composition, because I am familiar with it,
and because I believe the words of Eschylus and Homer
will be more durable than the marbles of Athens.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One more page and it will be finished. Its inspiration
withdrawn from me, my life will be more desolate than
ever. I shall seal it up carefully, and conceal it in some
safe place for the eyes and ears of a future generation
wiser and better than this. I shall then turn to Death
and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I salute thee.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall not wait long. After I left my prison in
Antioch and mingled with the turbulent tide of human
life, my spiritual visions left me, my spiritual senses were
closed. They are opening again. I have the old, beautiful
dreams. I hear the same heavenly music. I see the same
auroral and rainbow flashes of light. These now are
prophecies of death—nay, rather of life, of heaven. The
gates stand ajar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
My eyes, my hopes, my heart are steadily fixed on that
Land of Beauty, where the Son of the Desert will be
united to Martha; and John the Baptist to Mary; and
Lazarus to Magdalen; and all—all to Christ!

This book is philosophic, poetic, religious, without a
